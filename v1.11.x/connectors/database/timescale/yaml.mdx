## Requirements

**Note:** TimescaleDB is built on PostgreSQL. Note that we only support officially supported PostgreSQL versions. You can check the version list [here](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/).

### Usage and Lineage considerations

When extracting lineage and usage information from TimescaleDB we base our finding on the `pg_stat_statements` table.
You can find more information about it on the official [docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html#id-1.11.7.39.6).

Another interesting consideration here is explained in the following SO [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50803147/what-is-the-timeframe-for-pg-stat-statements).
As a summary:
- The `pg_stat_statements` has no time data embedded in it.
- It will show all queries from the last reset (one can call `pg_stat_statements_reset()`).

Then, when extracting usage and lineage data, the query log duration will have no impact, only the query limit.

**Note:** For usage and lineage grant your user `pg_read_all_stats` permission.

```sql
GRANT pg_read_all_stats TO your_user;
```


### Python Requirements

<PythonRequirements />

To run the TimescaleDB ingestion, you will need to install:

```bash
pip3 install "openmetadata-ingestion[postgres]"
```

### IAM Authentication

In order to be able to connect via IAM, you need to have the following:

1. Database is configured to use IAM authentication
Ensure that the RDS has IAM DB authentication enabled. Otherwise, you can click on Modify to enable it.

2. The user has the necessary IAM permissions
Even if you use IAM to connect to TimescaleDB, you need to specify a user to prepare the connection. You need to create a user as follows:

```sql
CREATE USER iam_user WITH LOGIN;
GRANT rds_iam TO iam_user;
```

3. The AWS Role has the necessary permissions
The role that is going to be used to perform the ingestion, needs to have the following permissions:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "rds-db:connect"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:rds-db:eu-west-1:<aws_account_number>:dbuser:<rds_db_resource_id>/<timescale_user>"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
Otherwise, you might be finding issues such as

PAM authentication failed for user "user"

## Metadata Ingestion

All connectors are defined as JSON Schemas.
[Here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/entity/services/connections/database/timescaleConnection.json)
you can find the structure to create a connection to TimescaleDB.

In order to create and run a Metadata Ingestion workflow, we will follow
the steps to create a YAML configuration able to connect to the source,
process the Entities if needed, and reach the OpenMetadata server.

The workflow is modeled around the following
[JSON Schema](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/metadataIngestion/workflow.json)

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={7} title="Ingest All Databases" lines="17">

**ingestAllDatabases**: When true, ingests data from all databases. Use `databaseFilterPattern` if you need to scope further.

#### Advanced Configuration

**Connection Options (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection options that can be sent to database during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.

**Connection Arguments (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection arguments such as security or protocol configs that can be sent to database during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.

- In case you are using Single-Sign-On (SSO) for authentication, add the `authenticator` details in the Connection Arguments as a Key-Value pair as follows: `"authenticator" : "sso_login_url"`

The sslConfig and sslMode are used to configure the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) connection between your application and the TimescaleDB server. TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL) will require only rootCertificate i.e caCertificate.

**caCertificate**: This is the path to the CA (Certificate Authority) certificate file. This file is used to verify the server's certificate.

**sslMode**: This field controls whether a secure SSL/TLS connection will be negotiated with the server. There are several modes you can choose:

disable: No SSL/TLS encryption will be used; the data sent over the network is not encrypted.
allow: The driver will try to negotiate a non-SSL connection but if the server insists on SSL, it will switch to SSL.
prefer (the default): The driver will try to negotiate an SSL connection but if the server does not support SSL, it will switch to a non-SSL connection.
require: The driver will try to negotiate an SSL connection. If the server does not support SSL, the driver will not fall back to a non-SSL connection.
verify-ca: The driver will negotiate an SSL connection and verify that the server certificate is issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA).
verify-full: The driver will negotiate an SSL connection, verify that the server certificate is issued by a trusted CA and check that the server host name matches the one in the certificate.

## Securing TimescaleDB Connection with SSL in OpenMetadata

To configure SSL for secure connections between OpenMetadata and a TimescaleDB database, TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL) offers various SSL modes, each providing different levels of connection security.

When running the ingestion process externally, specify the SSL mode to be used for the TimescaleDB connection, such as `prefer`, `verify-ca`, `allow`, and others. Once you've chosen the SSL mode, provide the CA certificate for SSL validation (`caCertificate`). Only the CA certificate is required for SSL validation in TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL).

<Tip>

For IAM authentication, it is recommended to select the `allow` mode or another SSL mode that aligns with your specific needs.

</Tip>

```yaml
      sslMode: disable #allow prefer require verify-ca verify-full
      sslConfig:
            caCertificate: "/path/to/ca/certificate"
```

## dbt Integration
