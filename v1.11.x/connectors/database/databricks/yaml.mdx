<Tip>
As per the [documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/tags.html#manage-tags-with-sql-commands) here, note that we only support metadata `tag` extraction for Databricks version 13.3 version and higher.
</Tip>
In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Databricks connector.
Configure and schedule Databricks metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
- [Query Usage](#query-usage)
- [Lineage](#lineage)
- [Data Profiler](#data-profiler)
- [Data Quality](#data-quality)
- [dbt Integration](#dbt-integration)
- [Reverse Metadata](/applications/reverse-metadata)
<ExternalIngestionDeployment />
## Requirements
### Python Requirements
<PythonRequirements />
To run the Databricks ingestion, you will need to install:
```bash
pip3 install "openmetadata-ingestion[databricks]"
```
### Permission Requirement
To enable full functionality of metadata extraction, profiling, usage, and lineage features in OpenMetadata, the following permissions must be granted to the relevant users in your Databricks environment.
### Metadata and Profiling Permissions
These permissions are required on the catalogs, schemas, and tables from which metadata and profiling information will be ingested.
```sql
GRANT USE CATALOG ON CATALOG <catalog_name> TO `<user>`;
GRANT USE SCHEMA ON SCHEMA <schema_name> TO `<user>`;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE <table_name> TO `<user>`;
```
Ensure these grants are applied to all relevant tables for metadata ingestion and profiling operations.
### Usage and Lineage
These permissions enable OpenMetadata to extract query history and construct lineage information.
```sql
GRANT SELECT ON SYSTEM.QUERY.HISTORY TO `<user>`;
GRANT USE SCHEMA ON SCHEMA system.query TO `<user>`;
```
These permissions allow access to Databricks system tables that track query activity, enabling lineage and usage statistics generation.
<Tip>
Adjust &lt;user&gt;, &lt;catalog_name&gt;, &lt;schema_name&gt;, and &lt;table_name&gt; according to your specific deployment and security requirements.
</Tip>
## Metadata Ingestion
All connectors are defined as JSON Schemas.
[Here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/entity/services/connections/database/databricksConnection.json)
you can find the structure to create a connection to Databricks.
In order to create and run a Metadata Ingestion workflow, we will follow
the steps to create a YAML configuration able to connect to the source,
process the Entities if needed, and reach the OpenMetadata server.
The workflow is modeled around the following
[JSON Schema](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/metadataIngestion/workflow.json)
### 1. Define the YAML Config

<CodePreview>

<ContentPanel>

<ContentSection id={1} title="Source Configuration" lines="1-3">

Configure the source type and service name for your Databricks connector.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={2} title="Catalog" lines="7">

**catalog**: Catalog of the data source (Example: hive_metastore). This is optional parameter, if you would like to restrict the metadata reading to a single catalog. When left blank, OpenMetadata Ingestion attempts to scan all the catalog.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={3} title="Database Schema" lines="8">

**databaseSchema**: DatabaseSchema of the data source. This is optional parameter, if you would like to restrict the metadata reading to a single databaseSchema. When left blank, OpenMetadata Ingestion attempts to scan all the databaseSchema.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={4} title="Token" lines="9">

**token**: Generated Token to connect to Databricks.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={5} title="Host Port" lines="10">

**hostPort**: Enter the fully qualified hostname and port number for your Databricks deployment in the Host and Port field.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={6} title="HTTP Path" lines="11">

**httpPath**: Databricks compute resources URL.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={7} title="Connection Timeout" lines="12">

**connectionTimeout**: The maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a successful connection to the data source. If the connection attempt takes longer than this timeout period, an error will be returned.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={8} title="Connection Options" lines="13">

**Connection Options (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection options that can be sent to database during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={9} title="Connection Arguments" lines="14">

**Connection Arguments (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection arguments such as security or protocol configs that can be sent to database during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.

- In case you are using Single-Sign-On (SSO) for authentication, add the `authenticator` details in the Connection Arguments as a Key-Value pair as follows: `"authenticator" : "sso_login_url"`
