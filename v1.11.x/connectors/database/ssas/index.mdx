In this section, we provide guides and references to use the SSAS connector.
Configure and schedule SSAS metadata and profiler workflows from the Collate UI:
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
    - [Connection Details](#connection-details)
- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/database/ssas/troubleshooting)
## Requirements
To extract metadata from SSAS, ensure the following requirements are met:
- **HTTP Access**: The SSAS service must be accessible via HTTP. You need to grant HTTP access to the SSAS instance.
- **Authentication**: HTTP access should be secured using Basic Authentication. Make sure you have a valid username and password with sufficient privileges to access the required models.
- **Model Deployment**: The SSAS models you want to ingest must be deployed and available in the SSAS instance.
- **Documentation**: For detailed steps on enabling HTTP access and configuring authentication for SSAS, please refer to the official SSAS documentation: [SSAS HTTP Access Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/instances/configure-http-access-to-analysis-services-on-iis-8-0?view=sql-analysis-services-2025)
These steps are necessary to allow the connector to communicate with your SSAS instance and retrieve metadata successfully.

# Connection Details

<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
</Tip>
- **HTTP Connection**: The HTTP endpoint (URL) for accessing your SSAS instance. This should be the address where your SSAS service is exposed for HTTP requests.
- **Username**: The username for authenticating to the SSAS HTTP endpoint. This user must have sufficient privileges to access the required models and metadata.
- **Password**: The password for the above username. The password is stored securely and used for Basic Authentication.
