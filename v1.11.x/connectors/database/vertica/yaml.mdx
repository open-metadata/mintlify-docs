In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Vertica connector.
Configure and schedule Vertica metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:

## Requirements
### Permissions
To run the ingestion we need a user with `SELECT` grants on the schemas that you'd like to ingest, as well as to the
`V_CATALOG` schema. You can grant those as follows for the schemas in your database:
```sql
CREATE USER openmetadata IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA PUBLIC TO openmetadata;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA V_CATALOG TO openmetadata;
```
Note that these `GRANT`s won't be applied to any new table created on the schema unless the schema
has [Inherited Privileges](https://www.vertica.com/docs/8.1.x/HTML/index.htm#Authoring/AdministratorsGuide/Security/DBUsersAndPrivileges/GrantInheritedPrivileges.htm)
```sql
ALTER SCHEMA s1 DEFAULT INCLUDE PRIVILEGES;
-- If using the PUBLIC schema
ALTER SCHEMA "<db>.public" DEFAULT INCLUDE PRIVILEGES;
```
#### Lineage and Usage
If you also want to run the Lineage and Usage workflows, then the user needs to be granted permissions to the
`V_MONITOR` schema:
```sql
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA V_MONITOR TO openmetadata;
```
Note that this setting might only grant visibility to the queries executed by this user. A more complete approach
will be to grant the `SYSMONITOR` role to the `openmetadata` user:
```sql
GRANT SYSMONITOR TO openmetadata;
ALTER USER openmetadata DEFAULT ROLE SYSMONITOR;
```
#### Profiler
To run the profiler, it's not enough to have `USAGE` permissions to the schema as we need to `SELECT` the tables
in there. Therefore, you'll need to grant `SELECT` on all tables for the schemas:
```sql
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema> TO openmetadata;
```
### Python Requirements
<PythonRequirements />
To run the Vertica ingestion, you will need to install:
```bash
pip3 install "openmetadata-ingestion[vertica]"
```
## Metadata Ingestion
All connectors are defined as JSON Schemas.
[Here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/entity/services/connections/database/verticaConnection.json)
you can find the structure to create a connection to Vertica.
In order to create and run a Metadata Ingestion workflow, we will follow
the steps to create a YAML configuration able to connect to the source,
process the Entities if needed, and reach the OpenMetadata server.
The workflow is modeled around the following
[JSON Schema](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/metadataIngestion/workflow.json)
### 1. Define the YAML Config
This is a sample config for Vertica:

<CodePreview>

<ContentPanel>

<ContentSection id={1} title="Source Configuration" lines="1-3">

Configure the source type and service name for your Vertica connector.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={2} title="username" lines="7">

**username**: Specify the User to connect to Vertica. It should have enough privileges to read all the metadata.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={3} title="password" lines="8">

**password**: Password to connect to Vertica.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={4} title="hostPort" lines="9">

**hostPort**: Enter the fully qualified hostname and port number for your Vertica deployment in the Host and Port field.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={5} title="database" lines="10">

**database**: Database of the data source. This is optional parameter, if you would like to restrict the metadata reading to a single database. When left blank, OpenMetadata Ingestion attempts to scan all the databases.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={6} title="Advanced Configuration" lines="11-12">

**Connection Options (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection options that can be sent to database during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.

**Connection Arguments (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection arguments such as security or protocol configs that can be sent to database during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.
- In case you are using Single-Sign-On (SSO) for authentication, add the `authenticator` details in the Connection Arguments as a Key-Value pair as follows: `"authenticator" : "sso_login_url"`

<ContentSection id={7} title="Source Config" lines="15-58">
