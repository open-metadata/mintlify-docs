In this section, we provide guides and references to use the PinotDB connector.
Configure and schedule PinotDB metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
- [Data Profiler](/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/profiler/profiler-workflow)
- [Data Quality](/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/quality)
- [dbt Integration](/connectors/ingestion/workflows/dbt)
- [Lineage](/how-to-guides/data-lineage/workflow)
- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/database/pinotdb/troubleshooting)

# Connection Details
<Steps>
<Step title="Connection Details">
<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
</Tip>
- **Username**: Specify the User to connect to PinotDB. It should have enough privileges to read all the metadata.
- **Password**: Password to connect to PinotDB.
- **Host and Port**: Enter the fully qualified hostname and port number for your PinotDB deployment in the Host and Port field.  Unlike broker host, prefix http:// or https:// must be added to controller host. For example, pinot broker host can be set to `localhost:8099` and pinot controller host can be set to `http://localhost:9000`.
- **databaseName**: Optional name to give to the database in OpenMetadata. If left blank, we will use default as the database name.
- **databaseSchema**: databaseSchema of the data source. This is optional parameter, if you would like to restrict the metadata reading to a single databaseSchema. When left blank, OpenMetadata Ingestion attempts to scan all the databaseSchema.
- **caCertificate**: Provide the path to ssl ca file.
- **sslCertificate**: Provide the path to ssl client certificate file (ssl_cert).
- **sslKey**: Provide the path to ssl client certificate file (ssl_key).
