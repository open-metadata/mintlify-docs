## Requirements
Make sure if you have whitelisted ingestion container IP on Azure SQL firewall rules. Checkout [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/firewall-configure?view=azuresql#use-the-azure-portal-to-manage-server-level-ip-firewall-rules) document on how to whitelist your IP using azure portal.
AzureSQL database user must grant `SELECT` privilege to fetch the metadata of tables and views.
```sql
-- Create a new user
-- More details https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-user-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16
CREATE USER Mary WITH PASSWORD = '********';
-- Grant SELECT on table
GRANT SELECT TO Mary;
```
## Metadata Ingestion
<MetadataIngestionUi connector={"AzureSQL"} selectServicePath={"/public/images/connectors/azuresql/select-service.png"} addNewServicePath={"/public/images/connectors/azuresql/add-new-service.png"} serviceConnectionPath={"/public/images/connectors/azuresql/service-connection.png"} />
# Connection Options
<Steps>
<Step title="Connection Options">
- **Username**: Specify the User to connect to AzureSQL. It should have enough privileges to read all the metadata.
- **Password**: Password to connect to AzureSQL.
- **Host and Port**: Enter the fully qualified hostname and port number for your AzureSQL deployment in the Host and Port field.
- **Database**: The database of the data source is an optional parameter, if you would like to restrict the metadata reading to a single database. If left blank, OpenMetadata ingestion attempts to scan all the databases.
- **Driver**: Connecting to AzureSQL requires ODBC driver to be installed. Specify ODBC driver name in the field.
You can download the ODBC driver from [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16). In case of docker or kubernetes deployment this driver comes out of the box with version  `ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server`.
**Authentication Mode**:
- **Authentication**:
   - The `authentication` parameter determines the method of authentication when connecting to AzureSQL using ODBC (Open Database Connectivity).
   - If you select **"Active Directory Password"**, you'll need to provide the password associated with your Azure Active Directory account.
   - Alternatively, if you choose **"Active Directory Integrated"**, the connection will use the credentials of the currently logged-in user. This mode ensures secure and seamless connections with AzureSQL.
- **Encrypt**:
   - The `encrypt` setting in the connection string pertains to data encryption during communication with AzureSQL.
   - When enabled, it ensures that data exchanged between your application and the database is encrypted, enhancing security.
- **Trust Server Certificate**:
   - The `trustServerCertificate` option also relates to security.
   - When set to true, your application will trust the server's SSL certificate without validation. Use this cautiously, as it bypasses certificate validation checks.
- **Connection Timeout**:
   - The `connectionTimeout` parameter specifies the maximum time (in seconds) that your application will wait while attempting to establish a connection to AzureSQL.
   - If the connection cannot be established within this timeframe, an error will be raised.
