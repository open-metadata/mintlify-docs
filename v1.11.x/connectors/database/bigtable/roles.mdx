You can search for the required permissions in the filter box and add them accordingly. To ingest metadata from BigTable you need to grant the following permissions to the user.

| #    | GCP Permission                | Required For            |
| :--- | :---------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| 1    | bigtable.instances.get        | Metadata Ingestion      |
| 2    | bigtable.instances.list       | Metadata Ingestion      |
| 3    | bigtable.tables.get           | Metadata Ingestion      |
| 4    | bigtable.tables.list          | Metadata Ingestion      |
| 5    | bigtable.tables.readRows      | Metadata Ingestion      |
