In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Cassandra connector.
Configure and schedule Cassandra metadata workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
- [Enable Security](#securing-cassandra-connection-with-ssl-in-openmetadata)
- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/database/cassandra/troubleshooting)
## Requirements
To extract metadata using the Cassandra connector, ensure the user in the connection has the following permissions:
- Read Permissions: The ability to query tables and perform data extraction.
- Schema Operations: Access to list and describe keyspaces and tables.
## Metadata Ingestion

# Connection Details
<Steps>
<Step title="Connection Details">
<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
</Tip>
- **Username**: Username to connect to Cassandra. This user must have the necessary permissions to perform metadata extraction and table queries.
- **Host Port**: When using the `cassandra` connecion schema, the hostPort parameter specifies the host and port of the Cassandra. This should be specified as a string in the format `hostname:port`. E.g., `localhost:9042`.- **databaseName**: Optional name to give to the database in OpenMetadata. If left blank, we will use default as the database name.
**Auth Type**: Following authentication types are supported:
1. **Basic Authentication**:
We'll use the user credentials to connect to Cassandra
- **password**: Password of the user.
2. **DataStax Astra DB Configuration**:
Configuration for connecting to DataStax Astra DB in the cloud.
  - **connectTimeout**: Timeout in seconds for establishing new connections to Cassandra.
  - **requestTimeout**: Timeout in seconds for individual Cassandra requests.
  - **token**: The Astra DB application token used for authentication.
  - **secureConnectBundle**: File path to the Secure Connect Bundle (.zip) used for a secure connection to DataStax Astra DB.
**SSL Modes**
There are a couple of types of SSL modes that Cassandra supports which can be added to ConnectionArguments, they are as follows:
- **disable**: SSL is disabled and the connection is not encrypted.
- **allow**: SSL is used if the server requires it.
- **prefer**: SSL is used if the server supports it.
- **require**: SSL is required.
- **verify-ca**: SSL must be used and the server certificate must be verified.
- **verify-full**: SSL must be used. The server certificate must be verified, and the server hostname must match the hostname attribute on the certificate.
**SSL Configuration**
In order to integrate SSL in the Metadata Ingestion Config, the user will have to add the SSL config under sslConfig which is placed in the source.

## Securing Cassandra Connection with SSL in OpenMetadata
To establish secure connections between OpenMetadata and a Cassandra database, you can use any SSL mode provided by Cassandra, except disable.
Under `Advanced Config`, after selecting the SSL mode, provide the CA certificate, SSL certificate and SSL key.
