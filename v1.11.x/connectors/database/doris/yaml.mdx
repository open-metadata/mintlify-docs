In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Doris connector.
Configure and schedule Doris metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
- [Data Profiler](#data-profiler)
- [Data Quality](#data-quality)
- [dbt Integration](#dbt-integration)
- [Enable Security](#securing-doris-connection-with-ssl-in-openmetadata)
<ExternalIngestionDeployment />
## Requirements
Metadata: Doris >= 1.2.0, Data Profiler: Doris >= 2.0.2
### Python Requirements
<PythonRequirements />
To run the Doris ingestion, you will need to install:
```bash
pip3 install "openmetadata-ingestion[doris]"
```
## Metadata Ingestion
All connectors are defined as JSON Schemas.
[Here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/entity/services/connections/database/dorisConnection.json)
you can find the structure to create a connection to Doris.
In order to create and run a Metadata Ingestion workflow, we will follow
the steps to create a YAML configuration able to connect to the source,
process the Entities if needed, and reach the OpenMetadata server.
The workflow is modeled around the following
[JSON Schema](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/metadataIngestion/workflow.json)
### 1. Define the YAML Config

<CodePreview>

<ContentPanel>

<ContentSection id={1} title="Source Configuration" lines="1-3">

Configure the source type and service name for your Doris connector.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={2} title="Username" lines="7">

**username**: Specify the User to connect to Doris. It should have enough privileges to read all the metadata.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={3} title="Password" lines="8">

**password**: Password to connect to Doris.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={4} title="Host and Port" lines="9">

**Host and Port**: Enter the fully qualified hostname and port number for your Doris deployment in the Host and Port field.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={5} title="Database Schema" lines="10">

**databaseSchema**: databaseSchema of the data source. This is optional parameter, if you would like to restrict the metadata reading to a single databaseSchema. When left blank, OpenMetadata Ingestion attempts to scan all the databaseSchema.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={6} title="Connection Options" lines="11">

**Connection Options (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection options that can be sent to database during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={7} title="Connection Arguments" lines="12">

**Connection Arguments (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection arguments such as security or protocol configs that can be sent to database during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.

- In case you are using Single-Sign-On (SSO) for authentication, add the `authenticator` details in the Connection Arguments as a Key-Value pair as follows: `"authenticator" : "sso_login_url"`

## Securing Doris Connection with SSL in OpenMetadata
To establish secure connections between OpenMetadata and Doris, navigate to the Advanced Config section. Here, you can provide the CA certificate used for SSL validation by specifying the `caCertificate`. Alternatively, if both client and server require mutual authentication, you'll need to use all three parameters: `ssl_key`, `ssl_cert`, and `ssl_ca`. In this case, `ssl_cert` is used for the client’s SSL certificate, `ssl_key` for the private key associated with the SSL certificate, and `ssl_ca` for the CA certificate to validate the server’s certificate.
```yaml
      sslConfig:
            caCertificate: "/path/to/ca_certificate"
            sslCertificate: "/path/to/your/ssl_cert"
            sslKey: "/path/to/your/ssl_key"
```
## Lineage
