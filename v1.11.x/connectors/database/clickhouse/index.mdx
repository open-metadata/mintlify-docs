## Requirements
Clickhouse user must grant `SELECT` privilege on `system.*` and schema/tables to fetch the metadata of tables and views.
* Create a new user
* More details https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/user
```sql
CREATE USER <username> IDENTIFIED WITH sha256_password BY <password>
```
* Grant Permissions
* More details on permissions can be found here at https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/grant
```sql
-- Grant SELECT and SHOW to that user
-- More details on permissions can be found here at https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/grant
GRANT SELECT, SHOW ON system.* to <username>;
GRANT SELECT ON <schema_name>.* to <username>;
```
### Profiler & Data Quality
Executing the profiler workflow or data quality tests, will require the user to have `SELECT` permission on the tables/schemas where the profiler/tests will be executed. More information on the profiler workflow setup can be found [here](/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/profiler/profiler-workflow) and data quality tests [here](/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/quality).
### Usage & Lineage
For the usage and lineage workflow, the user will need `SELECT` privilege. You can find more information on the usage workflow [here](/connectors/ingestion/workflows/usage) and the lineage workflow [here](/connectors/ingestion/workflows/lineage).

# Connection Options
<Steps>
<Step title="Connection Options">
- **Username**: Specify the User to connect to Clickhouse. It should have enough privileges to read all the metadata.
- **Password**: Password to connect to Clickhouse.
- **Host and Port**: Enter the fully qualified hostname and port number for your Clickhouse deployment in the Host and Port field.
- **Use HTTPS Protocol**: Enable this flag when the when the Clickhouse instance is hosted via HTTPS protocol. This flag is useful when you are using `clickhouse+http` connection scheme.
- **Secure Connection**: Establish secure connection with ClickHouse. ClickHouse supports secure communication over SSL/TLS to protect data in transit, by checking this option, it establishes secure connection with ClickHouse. This flag is useful when you are using `clickhouse+native` connection scheme.
- **Key File**: The key file path is the location when ClickHouse looks for a file containing the private key needed for secure communication over SSL/TLS. By default, ClickHouse will look for the key file in the `/etc/clickhouse-server directory`, with the file name `server.key`. However, this can be customized in the ClickHouse configuration file (`config.xml`). This flag is useful when you are using `clickhouse+native` connection scheme and the secure connection flag is enabled.
