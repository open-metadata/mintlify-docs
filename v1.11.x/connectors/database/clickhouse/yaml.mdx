## Requirements
Clickhouse user must grant `SELECT` privilege on `system.*` and schema/tables to fetch the metadata of tables and views.
* Create a new user
* More details https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/user
```sql
CREATE USER <username> IDENTIFIED WITH sha256_password BY <password>
```
* Grant Permissions
* More details on permissions can be found here at https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/grant
```sql
-- Grant SELECT and SHOW to that user
-- More details on permissions can be found here at https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/grant
GRANT SELECT, SHOW ON system.* to <username>;
GRANT SELECT ON <schema_name>.* to <username>;
```
### Profiler & Data Quality
Executing the profiler workflow or data quality tests, will require the user to have `SELECT` permission on the tables/schemas where the profiler/tests will be executed. More information on the profiler workflow setup can be found [here](/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/profiler/profiler-workflow) and data quality tests [here](/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/quality).
### Usage & Lineage
For the usage and lineage workflow, the user will need `SELECT` privilege. You can find more information on the usage workflow [here](/connectors/ingestion/workflows/usage) and the lineage workflow [here](/connectors/ingestion/workflows/lineage).
### Python Requirements
<PythonRequirements />
To run the Clickhouse ingestion, you will need to install:
```bash
pip3 install "openmetadata-ingestion[clickhouse]"
```
If you want to run the Usage Connector, you'll also need to install:
```bash
pip3 install "openmetadata-ingestion[clickhouse-usage]"
```
## Metadata Ingestion
All connectors are defined as JSON Schemas.
[Here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/entity/services/connections/database/clickhouseConnection.json)
you can find the structure to create a connection to Clickhouse.
In order to create and run a Metadata Ingestion workflow, we will follow
the steps to create a YAML configuration able to connect to the source,
process the Entities if needed, and reach the OpenMetadata server.
The workflow is modeled around the following
[JSON Schema](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/metadataIngestion/workflow.json)
### 1. Define the YAML Config

<CodePreview>

<ContentPanel>

<ContentSection id={1} title="Source Configuration" lines="1-3">

Configure the source type and service name for your Clickhouse connector.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={2} title="Username" lines="7">

**username**: Specify the User to connect to Clickhouse. It should have enough privileges to read all the metadata.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={3} title="Password" lines="8">

**password**: Password to connect to Clickhouse.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={4} title="Host Port" lines="9">

**hostPort**: Enter the fully qualified hostname and port number for your Clickhouse deployment in the Host and Port field.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={5} title="Database Schema" lines="10">

**databaseSchema**: databaseSchema of the data source. This is optional parameter, if you would like to restrict the metadata reading to a single databaseSchema. When left blank, OpenMetadata Ingestion attempts to scan all the databaseSchema.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={6} title="Duration" lines="11">

**duration**: The duration of a SQL connection in ClickHouse depends on the configuration of the connection and the workload being processed. Connections are kept open for as long as needed to complete a query, but they can also be closed based on duration set.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={7} title="Scheme" lines="12">

**scheme**: There are 2 types of schemes that the user can choose from.

- **clickhouse+http**: Uses ClickHouse's HTTP interface for communication. Widely supported, but slower than native.
- **clickhouse+native**: Uses the native ClickHouse TCP protocol for communication. Faster than http, but may require additional server-side configuration. Recommended for performance-critical applications.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={8} title="HTTPS" lines="13">

**https**: Enable this flag when the Clickhouse instance is hosted via HTTPS protocol. This flag is useful when you are using `clickhouse+http` connection scheme.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={9} title="Secure" lines="14">

**secure**: Establish secure connection with ClickHouse. ClickHouse supports secure communication over SSL/TLS to protect data in transit, by checking this option, it establishes secure connection with ClickHouse. This flag is useful when you are using `clickhouse+native` connection scheme.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={10} title="Keyfile" lines="15">

**keyfile**: The key file path is the location when ClickHouse looks for a file containing the private key needed for secure communication over SSL/TLS. By default, ClickHouse will look for the key file in the `/etc/clickhouse-server directory`, with the file name `server.key`. However, this can be customized in the ClickHouse configuration file (`config.xml`). This flag is useful when you are using `clickhouse+native` connection scheme and the secure connection flag is enabled.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={11} title="Connection Options" lines="16">

**Connection Options (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection options that can be sent to database during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={12} title="Connection Arguments" lines="17">

**Connection Arguments (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection arguments such as security or protocol configs that can be sent to database during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.

- In case you are using Single-Sign-On (SSO) for authentication, add the `authenticator` details in the Connection Arguments as a Key-Value pair as follows: `"authenticator" : "sso_login_url"`
