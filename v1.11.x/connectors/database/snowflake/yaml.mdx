In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Snowflake connector.
Configure and schedule Snowflake metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:

## Requirements
### Python Requirements
<PythonRequirements />
To run the Snowflake ingestion, you will need to install:
```bash
pip3 install "openmetadata-ingestion[snowflake]"
```
If you want to run the Usage Connector, you'll also need to install:
```bash
pip3 install "openmetadata-ingestion[snowflake-usage]"
```
To ingest basic metadata snowflake user must have the following privileges:
  - `USAGE` Privilege on Warehouse
  - `USAGE` Privilege on Database
  - `USAGE` Privilege on Schema
  - `SELECT` Privilege on Tables
```sql
-- Create New Role
CREATE ROLE NEW_ROLE;
-- Create New User
CREATE USER NEW_USER DEFAULT_ROLE=NEW_ROLE PASSWORD='PASSWORD';
-- Grant role to user
GRANT ROLE NEW_ROLE TO USER NEW_USER;
-- Grant USAGE Privilege on Warehouse to New Role
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE WAREHOUSE_NAME TO ROLE NEW_ROLE;
-- Grant USAGE Privilege on Database to New Role
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE TEST_DB TO ROLE NEW_ROLE;
-- Grant USAGE Privilege on required Schemas to New Role
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA TEST_SCHEMA TO ROLE NEW_ROLE;
-- Grant SELECT Privilege on required tables & views to New Role
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA TEST_SCHEMA TO ROLE NEW_ROLE;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL EXTERNAL TABLES IN SCHEMA TEST_SCHEMA TO ROLE NEW_ROLE;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN SCHEMA TEST_SCHEMA TO ROLE NEW_ROLE;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL DYNAMIC TABLES IN SCHEMA TEST_SCHEMA TO ROLE NEW_ROLE;
```
While running the usage workflow, Openmetadata fetches the query logs by querying `snowflake.account_usage.query_history` table. For this the snowflake user should be granted the `ACCOUNTADMIN` role or a role granted IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the database `SNOWFLAKE`.
```sql
-- Grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on all Schemas of SNOWFLAKE DB to New Role
GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE NEW_ROLE;
```
If ingesting tags, the user should also have permissions to query `snowflake.account_usage.tag_references`.For this the snowflake user should be granted the `ACCOUNTADMIN` role or a role granted IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the database
```sql
-- Grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on all Schemas of SNOWFLAKE DB to New Role
GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE NEW_ROLE;
```
You can find more information about the `account_usage` schema [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage).
## Metadata Ingestion
All connectors are defined as JSON Schemas.
[Here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/entity/services/connections/database/snowflakeConnection.json)
you can find the structure to create a connection to Snowflake.
In order to create and run a Metadata Ingestion workflow, we will follow
the steps to create a YAML configuration able to connect to the source,
process the Entities if needed, and reach the OpenMetadata server.
The workflow is modeled around the following
[JSON Schema](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/metadataIngestion/workflow.json)
### 1. Define the YAML Config

This is a sample config for Snowflake:

<CodePreview>

<ContentPanel>

<ContentSection id={1} title="Source Configuration" lines="1-3">

Configure the source type and service name for your Snowflake connector.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={2} title="Username" lines="7">

**username**: Specify the User to connect to Snowflake. It should have enough privileges to read all the metadata.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={3} title="Password" lines="8">

**password**: Password to connect to Snowflake.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={4} title="Warehouse" lines="9">

**warehouse**: Snowflake warehouse is required for executing queries to fetch the metadata. Enter the name of warehouse against which you would like to execute these queries.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={5} title="Account" lines="10">

**account**: Snowflake account identifier uniquely identifies a Snowflake account within your organization, as well as throughout the global network of Snowflake-supported cloud platforms and cloud regions. If the Snowflake URL is `https://xyz1234.us-east-1.gcp.snowflakecomputing.com`, then the account is `xyz1234.us-east-1.gcp`.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={6} title="Database" lines="11">

**database**: The database of the data source is an optional parameter, if you would like to restrict the metadata reading to a single database. If left blank, OpenMetadata ingestion attempts to scan all the databases.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={7} title="Account Usage Schema" lines="12">

**accountUsageSchema**: Full name of account usage schema, used in case your used do not have direct access to `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema. In such case you can replicate tables `QUERY_HISTORY`, `TAG_REFERENCES`, `PROCEDURES`, `FUNCTIONS` to a custom schema let's say `CUSTOM_DB.CUSTOM_SCHEMA` and provide the same name in this field.

When using this field make sure you have all these tables available within your custom schema  `QUERY_HISTORY`, `TAG_REFERENCES`, `PROCEDURES`, `FUNCTIONS`.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={8} title="Include Transient Tables" lines="13">

**includeTransientTables**: Optional configuration for ingestion of TRANSIENT and TEMPORARY tables, By default, it will skip the TRANSIENT and TEMPORARY tables.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={9} title="Include Streams" lines="14">

**includeStreams**: Optional configuration for ingestion of streams, By default, it will skip the streams.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={10} title="Client Session Keep Alive" lines="15">

**clientSessionKeepAlive**: Optional Configuration to keep the session active in case the ingestion job runs for longer duration.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={11} title="Private Key" lines="16">

**privateKey**: If you have configured the key pair authentication for the given user you will have to pass the private key associated with the user in this field. You can checkout [this](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth) doc to get more details about key-pair authentication.

- The multi-line key needs to be converted to one line with `\n` for line endings i.e. `-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----\nMII...\n...\n-----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----`

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={12} title="Snowflake Private Key Passphrase" lines="17">

**snowflakePrivatekeyPassphrase**: If you have configured the encrypted key pair authentication for the given user you will have to pass the paraphrase associated with the private key in this field. You can checkout [this](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth) doc to get more details about key-pair authentication.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={13} title="Role" lines="18">

**role**: You can specify the role of user that you would like to ingest with, if no role is specified the default roles assigned to user will be selected.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={14} title="Connection Options" lines="19">

#### Advanced Configuration

**Connection Options (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection options that can be sent to database during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={15} title="Connection Arguments" lines="20">

**Connection Arguments (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection arguments such as security or protocol configs that can be sent to database during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.

- In case you are using Single-Sign-On (SSO) for authentication, add the `authenticator` details in the Connection Arguments as a Key-Value pair as follows: `"authenticator" : "sso_login_url"`
