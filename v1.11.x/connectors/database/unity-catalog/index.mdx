In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Unity Catalog connector.
Configure and schedule Unity Catalog metadata workflow from the OpenMetadata UI:
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
- [Data Quality](/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/quality)
- [Lineage](/connectors/ingestion/lineage)

- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/database/unity-catalog/troubleshooting)
- [Reverse Metadata](#reverse-metadata)

## Requirements
### Permission Requirement
To enable full functionality of metadata extraction, profiling, usage, and lineage features in OpenMetadata, the following permissions must be granted to the relevant users in your Databricks environment.
### Metadata and Profiling Permissions
These permissions are required on the catalogs, schemas, and tables from which metadata and profiling information will be ingested.
```sql
GRANT USE CATALOG ON CATALOG <catalog_name> TO `<user>`;
GRANT USE SCHEMA ON SCHEMA <schema_name> TO `<user>`;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE <table_name> TO `<user>`;
```
Ensure these grants are applied to all relevant tables for metadata ingestion and profiling operations.
### Usage and Lineage
These permissions enable OpenMetadata to extract query history and construct lineage information.
```sql
GRANT SELECT ON SYSTEM.QUERY.HISTORY TO `<user>`;
GRANT USE SCHEMA ON SCHEMA system.query TO `<user>`;
```
These permissions allow access to Databricks system tables that track query activity, enabling lineage and usage statistics generation.
<Tip>
Adjust &lt;user&gt;, &lt;catalog_name&gt;, &lt;schema_name&gt;, and &lt;table_name&gt; according to your specific deployment and security requirements.

# Connection Details
<Steps>
<Step title="Connection Details">
<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
</Tip>
- **Host and Port**: Enter the fully qualified hostname and port number for your Databricks deployment in the Host and Port field.
- **Token**: Generated Token to connect to Databricks.
- **HTTP Path**: Databricks compute resources URL.
- **connectionTimeout**: The maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a successful connection to the data source. If the connection attempt takes longer than this timeout period, an error will be returned.
- **Catalog**: Catalog of the data source(Example: hive_metastore). This is optional parameter, if you would like to restrict the metadata reading to a single catalog. When left blank, OpenMetadata Ingestion attempts to scan all the catalog.
- **DatabaseSchema**: databaseSchema of the data source. This is optional parameter, if you would like to restrict the metadata reading to a single databaseSchema. When left blank, OpenMetadata Ingestion attempts to scan all the databaseSchema.
