In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Presto connector.
Configure and schedule Presto metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
- [Data Profiler](/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/profiler/profiler-workflow)
- [Data Quality](/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/quality)
- [dbt Integration](/connectors/ingestion/workflows/dbt)
- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/database/presto/troubleshooting)
## Requirements
### Metadata
To extract metadata, the user needs to be able to perform `SHOW CATALOGS`, `SHOW TABLES`, and `SHOW COLUMNS FROM` on the catalogs/tables you wish to extract metadata from and have `SELECT` permission on the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`. Access to resources will be different based on the connector used. You can find more details in the Presto documentation website [here](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/connector.html). You can also get more information regarding system access control in Presto [here](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/security/built-in-system-access-control.html).
### Profiler & Data Quality
Executing the profiler workflow or data quality tests, will require the user to have `SELECT` permission on the tables/schemas where the profiler/tests will be executed. More information on the profiler workflow setup can be found [here](/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/profiler/profiler-workflow) and data quality tests [here](/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/quality).
## Metadata Ingestion
<MetadataIngestionUi connector={"Presto"} selectServicePath={"/public/images/connectors/presto/select-service.png"} addNewServicePath={"/public/images/connectors/presto/add-new-service.png"} serviceConnectionPath={"/public/images/connectors/presto/service-connection.png"} />
# Connection Options
<Steps>
<Step title="Connection Options">
- **Username**: Specify the User to connect to Presto. It should have enough privileges to read all the metadata.
- **Password**: Password to connect to Presto.
- **Host and Port**: Enter the fully qualified hostname and port number for your Presto deployment in the Host and Port field.
- **Catalog**: Presto offers a catalog feature where all the databases are stored.
- **DatabaseSchema**: DatabaseSchema of the data source. This is optional parameter, if you would like to restrict the metadata reading to a single databaseSchema. When left blank, OpenMetadata Ingestion attempts to scan all the databaseSchema.
