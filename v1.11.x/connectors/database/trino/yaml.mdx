## Requirements
### Python Requirements
<PythonRequirements />
To run the Trino ingestion, you will need to install:
```bash
pip3 install "openmetadata-ingestion[trino]"
```
<Columns cols={2}>
To extract metadata, the user needs to be able to have `SELECT` privilege on all the tables that you would like to ingest in OpenMetadata as well as `SELECT` privilege `system.metadata.table_comments` table.
</Columns>
## Metadata Ingestion
All connectors are defined as JSON Schemas.
[Here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/entity/services/connections/database/trinoConnection.json)
you can find the structure to create a connection to Trino.
In order to create and run a Metadata Ingestion workflow, we will follow
the steps to create a YAML configuration able to connect to the source,
process the Entities if needed, and reach the OpenMetadata server.
The workflow is modeled around the following
[JSON Schema](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/metadataIngestion/workflow.json)
### 1. Define the YAML Config
This is a sample config for Trino:

<CodePreview>

<ContentPanel>

<ContentSection id={1} title="Source Configuration" lines="1-3">

Configure the source type and service name for your Trino connector.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={2} title="hostPort" lines="7">

**hostPort**: Enter the fully qualified hostname and port number for your Trino deployment in the Host and Port field.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={3} title="username" lines="8">

**username**: Specify the User to connect to Trino. It should have enough privileges to read all the metadata.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={4} title="authType" lines="9-18">

**authType**: User can authenticate the Trino Instance with auth type as `Basic Authentication` i.e. Password **or** by using `JWT Authentication`.
  - **Basic Auth**:
    - **password**: Password to connect to Trino.
  - **JWT Auth Config**:
    - **jwt**: JWT can be used to authenticate with trino. Follow the steps in the [official trino](https://trino.io/docs/current/security/jwt.html) documentation to setup trino with jwt.
  - **Azure**:
    - **clientId**: To get the Client ID (also known as application ID), follow these steps:
        1. Log into [Microsoft Azure](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#allservices).
        2. Search for `App registrations` and select the `App registrations link`.
        3. Select the `Azure AD` app you're using for Trino.
        4. From the Overview section, copy the `Application (client) ID`.
    - **clientSecret**: To get the client secret, follow these steps:
        1. Log into [Microsoft Azure](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#allservices).
        2. Search for `App registrations` and select the `App registrations link`.
        3. Select the `Azure AD` app you're using for Trino.
        4. Under `Manage`, select `Certificates & secrets`.
        5. Under `Client secrets`, select `New client secret`.
        6. In the `Add a client secret` pop-up window, provide a description for your application secret. Choose when the application should expire, and select `Add`.
        7. From the `Client secrets` section, copy the string in the `Value` column of the newly created application secret.
    - **tenantId**: To get the tenant ID, follow these steps:
        1. Log into [Microsoft Azure](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#allservices).
        2. Search for `App registrations` and select the `App registrations link`.
        3. Select the `Azure AD` app you're using for Trino.
        4. From the `Overview` section, copy the `Directory (tenant) ID`.
    - **scopes**: To let OM use the Trino Auth APIs using your Azure AD app, you'll need to add the scope
        1. Log into [Microsoft Azure](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#allservices).
        2. Search for `App registrations` and select the `App registrations link`.
        3. Select the `Azure AD` app you're using for Trino.
        4. From the `Expose an API` section, copy the `Application ID URI`
        5. Make sure the URI ends with `/.default` in case it does not, you can append the same manually

<ContentSection id={5} title="catalog" lines="19">

**catalog**: Trino offers a catalog feature where all the databases are stored.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={6} title="DatabaseSchema" lines="20">

**DatabaseSchema**: DatabaseSchema of the data source. This is optional parameter, if you would like to restrict the metadata reading to a single databaseSchema. When left blank, OpenMetadata Ingestion attempts to scan all the databaseSchema.

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={7} title="proxies" lines="21-23">

**proxies**: Proxies for the connection to Trino data source

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={8} title="params" lines="25">

**params**: URL parameters for connection to the Trino data source

</ContentSection>

<ContentSection id={9} title="Advanced Configuration" lines="26">

**Connection Options (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection options that can be sent to database during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.

**Connection Arguments (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection arguments such as security or protocol configs that can be sent to database during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.
- In case you are using Single-Sign-On (SSO) for authentication, add the `authenticator` details in the Connection Arguments as a Key-Value pair as follows: `"authenticator" : "sso_login_url"`

## SSL Configuration
In order to integrate SSL in the Metadata Ingestion Config, the user will have to add the SSL config under **connectionArguments** which is placed in source.
<Steps>
<Step title="SSL Modes">
### SSL Modes
There are couple of types of SSL modes that redshift supports which can be added to ConnectionArguments, they are as follows:
- **false**: In order to disable SSL verification, set the `verify` parameter to `False`.
- **\<path-to-crt\>**: To use self-signed certificates, specify a path to the certificate in `verify` parameter.
More details can be found in [the Python requests library documentation](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced.html?highlight=ssl#ssl-cert-verification).
