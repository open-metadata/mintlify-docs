In this section, we provide guides and references to use the SAS connector.
Configure and schedule SAS metadata workflow from the OpenMetadata UI:
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/database/sas/troubleshooting)
## Requirements

## Metadata Ingestion
Prepare the SAS Service and configure the Ingestion:
<MetadataIngestionUi connector={"SAS"} selectServicePath={"/public/images/connectors/sas/select-service.png"} addNewServicePath={"/public/images/connectors/sas/add-new-service.png"} serviceConnectionPath={"/public/images/connectors/sas/service-connection.png"} />

<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
</Tip>
- **ServerHost**: Host and port of the SAS Viya deployment.
- **Username**: Username to connect to SAS Viya. This user should have privileges to read all the metadata in SAS Information Catalog.
- **Password**: Password to connect to SAS Viya.
- **Filter**: A filter expression specifying items for import. For more information [see](https://developer.sas.com/apis/rest/DataManagement/#catalog)
