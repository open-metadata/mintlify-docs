In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Impala connector.
Configure and schedule Impala metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
- [Data Profiler](/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/profiler/profiler-workflow)
- [Lineage](/how-to-guides/data-lineage/workflow)
- [Data Quality](/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/quality)
- [dbt Integration](/connectors/ingestion/workflows/dbt)
- [Enable Security](#securing-impala-connection-with-ssl-in-openmetadata)
- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/database/impala/troubleshooting)

# Connection Details
<Steps>
<Step title="Connection Details">
<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
</Tip>
- **username**: Specify the User to connect to Impala. It should have enough privileges to read all the metadata.
- **password**: Password to connect to Impala.
- **hostPort**: Enter the fully qualified hostname and port number for your Impala deployment in the Host and Port field.
- **authMechanism**: This parameter specifies the authentication method to use when connecting to the Impala server. Possible values are `NOSASL`, `PLAIN`, `GSSAPI`, `LDAP`, `JWT`. If you are using Kerberos authentication, you should set auth to `GSSAPI`.
- **kerberosServiceName**: This parameter specifies the Kerberos service name to use for authentication. This should only be specified if using Kerberos authentication.
- **databaseSchema**: Schema of the data source. This is optional parameter, if you would like to restrict the metadata reading to a single schema. When left blank, OpenMetadata Ingestion attempts to scan all the schemas.
- **databaseName**: In OpenMetadata, the Database Service hierarchy works as follows:
`Database Service > Database > Schema > Table`. In the case of Impala, we won't have a Database as such. If you'd like to see your data in a database named something other than `default`, you can specify the name in this field.
- **useSSL**: Establish secure connection with Impala. Enables SSL for the connector.
- **authOptions**: Enter the auth options string for impala connection.

## Securing Impala Connection with SSL in OpenMetadata
To configure SSL for secure connections between OpenMetadata and an Impala database, add the key `use_ssl` with a value of `true` to the `connectionArguments` to enable SSL. Additionally, include the key `ca_cert` with the path to the CA certificate file as its value. Ensure that the certificate file is accessible by the server, and if deploying via Docker or Kubernetes, update the CA certificate in the OpenMetadata server to reflect these changes.
