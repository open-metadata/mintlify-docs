# Connection Details
<Steps>
<Step title="Connection Details">
<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
</Tip>
- **Username**: Specify the User to connect to Cockroach. It should have enough privileges to read all the metadata.
- **Auth Type**: Basic Auth or IAM based auth to connect to instances / cloud rds.
  - **Basic Auth**:
    - **Password**: Password to connect to Cockroach

- **Host and Port**: Enter the fully qualified hostname and port number for your Cockroach deployment in the Host and Port field.

**SSL Modes**
There are a couple of types of SSL modes that Cockroach supports which can be added to ConnectionArguments, they are as follows:
- **disable**: SSL is disabled and the connection is not encrypted.
- **allow**: SSL is used if the server requires it.
- **prefer**: SSL is used if the server supports it.
- **require**: SSL is required.
- **verify-ca**: SSL must be used and the server certificate must be verified.
- **verify-full**: SSL must be used. The server certificate must be verified, and the server hostname must match the hostname attribute on the certificate.
**SSL Configuration**
In order to integrate SSL in the Metadata Ingestion Config, the user will have to add the SSL config under sslConfig which is placed in the source.
## Securing Cockroach Connection with SSL in OpenMetadata
To establish secure connections between OpenMetadata and a Cockroach database, you can configure SSL using different SSL modes provided by Cockroach, each offering varying levels of security.
Under `Advanced Config`, specify the SSL mode appropriate for your connection, such as `prefer`, `verify-ca`, `allow`, and others. After selecting the SSL mode, provide the CA certificate used for SSL validation (`caCertificate`). Note that Cockroach requires only the CA certificate for SSL validation.
