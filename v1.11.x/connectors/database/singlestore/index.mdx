In this section, we provide guides and references to use the SingleStore connector.
Configure and schedule SingleStore metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:

- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/database/singlestore/troubleshooting)
## Requirements
### Metadata
To extract metadata the user used in the connection needs to have access to the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.  By default a user can see only the rows in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` that correspond to objects for which the user has the proper access privileges.
```SQL
-- Create user.
-- More details https://docs.singlestore.com/managed-service/en/reference/sql-reference/security-management-commands/create-user.html
CREATE USER <username>[@<hostName>] IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
-- Grant select on a database
GRANT SELECT ON world.* TO '<username>';
-- Grant select on a database
GRANT SELECT ON world.* TO '<username>';
-- Grant select on a specific object
GRANT SELECT ON world.hello TO '<username>';
```
### Profiler & Data Quality
Executing the profiler workflow or data quality tests, will require the user to have `SELECT` permission on the tables/schemas where the profiler/tests will be executed. More information on the profiler workflow setup can be found [here](/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/profiler/profiler-workflow) and data quality tests [here](/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/quality).

# Connection Details
<Steps>
<Step title="Connection Details">
<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
</Tip>
- **Username**: Specify the User to connect to SingleStore. It should have enough privileges to read all the metadata.
- **Password**: Password to connect to SingleStore.
- **Host and Port**: Enter the fully qualified hostname and port number for your SingleStore deployment in the Host and Port field.
- **databaseName**: Optional name to give to the database in OpenMetadata. If left blank, we will use default as the database name.
