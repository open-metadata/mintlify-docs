In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Presto connector.
Configure and schedule Presto metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:

- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/database/sqlite/troubleshooting)
## Requirements
### Metadata
To extract metadata, the user needs to be able to perform `.tables`, `.schema`, on database you wish to extract metadata from and have `SELECT` permission on the `sqlite_temp_master`. Access to resources will be different based on the connector used.
## Metadata Ingestion

<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
</Tip>
- **Username**: Username to connect to SQLite. Blank for in-memory database.
- **Password**: Password to connect to SQLite. Blank for in-memory database.
- **Host and Port**: Enter the fully qualified hostname and port number for your SQLite deployment in the Host and Port field.
- **Database**: The database of the data source is an optional parameter, if you would like to restrict the metadata reading to a single database. If left blank, OpenMetadata ingestion attempts to scan all the databases.
- **Database Mode**: How to run the SQLite database. :memory: by default.
