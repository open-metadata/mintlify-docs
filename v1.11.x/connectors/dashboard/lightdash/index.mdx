In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Lightdash connector.
Configure and schedule Lightdash metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:

## Requirements
To integrate Lightdash, ensure you are using OpenMetadata version 1.2.x or higher.

<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
</Tip>
- **Host and Port**: Specify the network location where your Lightdash instance is accessible, combining both hostname and port in a URI format: either `http://hostname:port` or `https://hostname:port`, based on your security needs.
   - **Example**: For a local setup, use `http://localhost:8080`; for a server deployment, it might be `https://lightdash.example.com:3000`.
   - Ensure the specified port is open and accessible through network firewall settings.
- **API Key**: This key authenticates requests to your Lightdash instance. Keep the API Key secure, sharing it only with authorized applications or users.
- **Project UUID**: This unique identifier links API requests or configurations to a specific project in Lightdash.
- **Space UUID**: Identifies a specific "Space" in Lightdash, used to organize dashboards, charts, and assets.
- **Proxy Authentication**: If your Lightdash instance requires authentication through a proxy server, provide proxy credentials. Proxy authentication controls access to external resources and Lightdash.
