# Connection Details
<Steps>
<Step title="Connection Details">
<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
</Tip>
**Host and Port**:
This parameter specifies the host and port of the Metabase instance. This should be specified as a URI string in the format `http://hostname:port` or `https://hostname:port`.
For example, you might set it to `http://192.168.1.1:80`.
**Username**:
Username to connect to PowerBI Report Server.
**Password**:
Password to connect to PowerBI Report Server.
**Web Portal Virtual Directory Name**
Web Portal Virtual Directory name which you have configured in your PowerBI Report Server configuration manager.
