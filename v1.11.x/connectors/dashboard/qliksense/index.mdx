# Connection Details
<Steps>
<Step title="Connection Details">
<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
</Tip>
- **Qlik Sense Base URL**: This field refers to the base url of your Qlik Sense Portal, will be used for generating the redirect links for dashboards and charts. Example: `https://server.domain.com` or `https://server.domain.com/<proxy-path>`
- **Qlik Engine JSON API Websocket URL**: Enter the websocket url of Qlik Sense Engine JSON API. Refer to [this](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense-developer/May2023/Subsystems/EngineAPI/Content/Sense_EngineAPI/GettingStarted/connecting-to-engine-api.htm) document for more details about. Example: `wss://server.domain.com:4747` or `wss://server.domain.com[/virtual proxy]`.
Since we use the Qlik Sense Engine APIs, we need to authenticate to those APIs using certificates generated on Qlik Management Console.
**Qlik Certificate By Values**: In this approach we provide the content of the certificates to the relevant field.
 - **Client Certificate Value**: This field specifies the value of `client.pem` certificate required for authentication.
 - **Client Key Certificate Value**: This field specifies the value of `client_key.pem` certificate required for authentication.
 - **Root Certificate Value**: This field specifies the value of `root.pem` certificate required for authentication.
 - **Staging Directory Path**: This field specifies the path to temporary staging directory, where the certificates will be stored temporarily during the ingestion process, which will de deleted once the ingestion job is over.
when you are using this approach make sure you are passing the key in a correct format. If your certificate looks like this:
```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MII..
MBQ...
CgU..
8Lt..
...
h+4=
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```
You will have to replace new lines with `\n` and the final private key that you need to pass should look like this:
```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMII..\nMBQ...\nCgU..\n8Lt..\n...\nh+4=\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n
```
**Qlik Certificate By Path**: In this approach we provide the path of the certificates to the certificate stored in the container or environment running the ingestion workflow.
 - **Client Certificate Path**: This field specifies the path of `client.pem` certificate required for authentication.
 - **Client Key Certificate Value**: This field specifies the path of `client_key.pem` certificate required for authentication.
 - **Root Certificate Value**: This field specifies the path of `root.pem` certificate required for authentication.
**User Directory**: This field specifies the user directory of the user.
**User ID**: This field specifies the user id of the user.
**Validate Host Name**: Enable/Disable this field to validate the host name against the provided certificates.

## Securing Qlik Sense Connection with SSL in OpenMetadata
To establish secure connections between OpenMetadata and Qlik Sense, there are two ways to communicate: defining the certificate file path or using the certificates value. Navigate to the `Advanced Config` section.
When using the local certificate file path, ensure that the certificates are accessible from the Airflow Server. You can specify the path for the `client certificate`, `client key certificate`, and `root certificate`.
Alternatively, when using the certificates value, you can provide the CA certificate used for SSL validation by specifying the `CA Certificate`. If both client and server require mutual authentication, you can upload all three: `CA Certificate`, `SSL Certificate`, and `SSL Key`.
Refer to the guide on how to generate authentication certificates so that OpenMetadata can communicate with Qlik Sense [here](/connectors/dashboard/qliksense/certificates).
