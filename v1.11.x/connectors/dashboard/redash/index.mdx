In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Redash connector.
Configure and schedule Redash metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
- [Lineage](#lineage)
- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/dashboard/redash/troubleshooting)
## Requirements
We connect to Redash through the [API](https://redash.io/help/user-guide/integrations-and-api/api) endpoint, so the user
we use in the configuration to ingest data must have enough permissions to view all the data. For more info about the
permissions, please visit Redash documentation [here](https://redash.io/help/user-guide/users/permissions-groups).
## Metadata Ingestion

# Connection Details
<Steps>
<Step title="Connection Details">
<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
</Tip>
- **Host and Port**: URL to the Redash instance.
- **Username**: Specify the User to connect to Redash. It should have enough privileges to read all the metadata.
- **API Key**: API key of the redash instance to access. It has the same permissions as the user who owns it. Can be found on a user profile page.
- **Redash Version**: Redash version of your redash instance. Enter the numerical value from the [Redash Releases](https://github.com/getredash/redash/releases) page. Default: `10.0.0`.
