In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Metabase connector.
Configure and schedule Metabase metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
- [Lineage](#lineage)
- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/dashboard/metabase/troubleshooting)
## Requirements
The service account must have view access to all dashboards and charts that need to be ingested. Without view access, the connector cannot retrieve those objects.
**Note:** We have tested Metabase with Versions `0.42.4` and `0.43.4`.
## Metadata Ingestion

# Connection Details
<Steps>
<Step title="Connection Details">
<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
</Tip>
- **Host and Port**: The hostPort parameter specifies the host and port of the Metabase instance. This should be specified as a string in the format `http://hostname:port` or `https://hostname:port`. For example, you might set the hostPort parameter to `https://org.metabase.com:3000`.
- **Username**: Username to connect to Metabase, for ex. `user@organization.com`. This user should have access to relevant dashboards and charts in Metabase to fetch the metadata.
- **Password**: Password of the user account to connect with Metabase.
