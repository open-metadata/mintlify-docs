## Requirements
To access the ThoughtSpot APIs and import liveboards, charts, and data models from ThoughtSpot into OpenMetadata, you need appropriate permissions on your ThoughtSpot instance.
### ThoughtSpot Account Setup and Permissions
1. **Authentication Setup**
   ThoughtSpot supports multiple authentication methods:
   - **Basic Authentication:** Username and password authentication. The user should have appropriate permissions to read metadata from ThoughtSpot.
   - **API Token Authentication:** Use ThoughtSpot API tokens for authentication. Generate API tokens from your ThoughtSpot instance.
2. **API Permissions**
   Ensure your ThoughtSpot user or service account has the following permissions:
   - Read access to liveboards and answers
   - Read access to worksheets and data models
   - Access to metadata APIs
   - Export permissions for TML (ThoughtSpot Modeling Language) data
3. **Multi-tenant Configuration (Optional)**
   If you're using ThoughtSpot Cloud with multiple organizations:
   - Set the `Organization ID` parameter to specify which organization to connect to (only for ThoughtSpot Cloud).
<Tip>
- For lineage extraction, ensure TML (ThoughtSpot Modeling Language) export is enabled for your user.
</Tip>
## Connection Details
- **Host and Port:**
  The URL of your ThoughtSpot instance.
  Examples:
  - Cloud: `https://my-company.thoughtspot.cloud`
  - On-premise: `https://thoughtspot.company.com`
  - Local: `https://localhost`
  If running ingestion in Docker and ThoughtSpot is on `localhost`, use `host.docker.internal`.
- **Authentication:**
  Choose one of the following:
  - **Basic Authentication:**
    - Username: Your ThoughtSpot username
    - Password: Your ThoughtSpot password
  - **API Token Authentication:**
    - API Token: Your ThoughtSpot API token
- **API Version:**
  The ThoughtSpot API version to use for metadata extraction.
  - `v1`: Legacy API version (callosum endpoints)
  - `v2`: Current API version (recommended, default)
- **Organization ID:**
  For multi-tenant ThoughtSpot Cloud deployments.
  - Leave empty for single-tenant
  - Set to your org ID for multi-tenant
## Metadata Ingestion
<MetadataIngestionUi connector={"ThoughtSpot"} selectServicePath={"/public/images/connectors/thoughtspot/select-service.png"} addNewServicePath={"/public/images/connectors/thoughtspot/add-new-service.png"} serviceConnectionPath={"/public/images/connectors/thoughtspot/service-connection.png"} />
## Connection Configuration
<Steps>
<TestConnection />
<ConfigureIngestion />
<IngestionScheduleAndDeploy />
</Steps>
**Note:**
Lineage creation requires:
- Database service names to be configured in the lineage information
- Access to TML export functionality
Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues:
```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```
This will provide detailed information about API calls, data extraction, and lineage creation.
