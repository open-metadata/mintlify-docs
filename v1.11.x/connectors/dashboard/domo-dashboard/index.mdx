# Connection Details
<Steps>
<Step title="Connection Details">
<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
</Tip>
- **Client ID**: Client ID to Connect to DOMO Dashboard.
- **Secret Token**: Secret Token to Connect DOMO Dashboard.
- **Access Token**: Access to Connect to DOMO Dashboard.
- **API Host**:  API Host to Connect to DOMO Dashboard instance.
- **Instance Domain**: URL to connect to your Domo instance UI. For example `https://<your>.domo.com`.
