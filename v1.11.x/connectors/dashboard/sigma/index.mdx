In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Sigma connector.
Configure and schedule Sigma metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
- [Lineage](#lineage)
- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/dashboard/sigma/troubleshooting)
## Requirements
OpenMetadata relies on Sigma's REST API. To know more you can read the [Sigma API Get Started docs](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/reference/get-started-sigma-api#about-the-api). To [generate API client credentials](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/reference/generate-client-credentials#user-requirements), you must be assigned the Admin account type.

# Connection Details
<Steps>
<Step title="Connection Details">
<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
</Tip>
**hostPort**: Host and Port Sigma REST API.
The hostPort parameter specifies the host and port of the Sigma's API request URL. This should be specified as a string in the format `https://aws-api.sigmacomputing.com`. Sigma's API request URL varies according to the sigma cloud. you can determine your API url by following the docs [here](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/reference/get-started-sigma-api#identify-your-api-request-url)
**clientId**: Client Id for Sigma REST API.
Get the Client Id and client Secret by following below steps:
- Navigate to your Sigma homepage.
- Click on Administration in the lower left corner.
- Click on Developer Access on the left side.
- To generate a new Client Id and client Secret, On upper left corner click `Create New`.
- Enter the required details asked and click `Create`.
- Copy the generated access token and password.
For detailed information visit [here](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/reference/generate-client-credentials#generate-api-client-credentials).
**clientSecret**: Client Secret for Sigma REST API.
Copy the access token password from the step above where a new token is generated.
For detailed information visit [here](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/reference/generate-client-credentials#generate-api-client-credentials).
**apiVersion**: Sigma REST API Version.
Version of the Sigma REST API by default `v2`.
To get to know the Sigma REST API Version visit [here](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/reference/get-started-sigma-api#identify-your-api-request-url) and look into the `Token URL` section.
