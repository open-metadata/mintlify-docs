In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Mode connector.
Configure and schedule Mode metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
- [Lineage](#lineage)
- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/dashboard/mode/troubleshooting)
## Requirements
OpenMetadata relies on Mode's API, which is exclusive to members of the Mode Business Workspace. This means that only resources that belong to a Mode Business Workspace can be accessed via the API.
## Metadata Ingestion

# Connection Details

<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
</Tip>
**hostPort**: Host and Port Mode Dashboard.
The hostPort parameter specifies the host and port of the Mode server. This should be specified as a string in the format `https://app.mode.com`.
**accessToken**: Access Token for Mode Dashboard.
Get the Access Token by following below steps:
- Navigate to your Mode homepage.
- Click on your name in the upper left corner and click My Account.
- Click on API Tokens on the left side.
- To generate a new API token and password, enter a token name and click `Create token`.
- Copy the generated access token and password.

**accessTokenPassword**: Access Token Password for Mode Dashboard.
Copy the access token password from the step above where a new token is generated.
