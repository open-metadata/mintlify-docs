In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Airflow connector.
Configure and schedule Airflow metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)

## Requirements
### Python Requirements
<PythonRequirements />
To run the Airflow ingestion, you will need to install:
```bash
pip3 install "openmetadata-ingestion[airflow]"
```
<Tip>
Note that this installs the same Airflow version that we ship in the Ingestion Container. If you are running
the ingestion from Airflow already, you **DON'T NEED** to install the `airflow` plugin.
Instead, just run `pip3 install "openmetadata-ingestion"`.
</Tip>
**Note:** we only support officially supported Airflow versions. You can check the version list [here](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation/supported-versions.html).
## Metadata Ingestion
All connectors are defined as JSON Schemas.
[Here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/entity/services/connections/pipeline/airflowConnection.json)
you can find the structure to create a connection to Airflow.
In order to create and run a Metadata Ingestion workflow, we will follow
the steps to create a YAML configuration able to connect to the source,
process the Entities if needed, and reach the OpenMetadata server.
The workflow is modeled around the following
[JSON Schema](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/metadataIngestion/workflow.json)
### 1. Define the YAML Config
This is a sample config for Airflow:
<CodePreview>
<ContentPanel>
<ContentSection id={1} title="connection" lines="4-9">
**connection**: Airflow metadata database connection. See
  these [docs](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/set-up-database.html)
  for supported backends.
In terms of `connection` we support the following selections:
- `backend`: Should not be used from the UI. This is only applicable when ingesting Airflow metadata locally by running
  the ingestion from a DAG. It will use the current Airflow SQLAlchemy connection to extract the data.
- `MySQL`, `Postgres`, and `SQLite`: Pass the required credentials to reach out each of these services. We will
  create a connection to the pointed database and read Airflow data from there.
**hostPort**: URL to the Airflow instance.
</ContentSection>
<ContentSection id={2} title="numberOfStatus" lines="8">
**numberOfStatus**: Number of status we want to look back to in every ingestion (e.g., Past executions from a DAG).
