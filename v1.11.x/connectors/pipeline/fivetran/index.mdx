In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Fivetran connector.
Configure and schedule Fivetran metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/pipeline/fivetran/troubleshooting)
## Requirements
To access Fivetran APIs, a Fivetran account on a Standard, Enterprise, or Business Critical plan is required.

# Connection Details

<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
</Tip>
**apiKey**: Fivetran API Key.
Follow the steps mentioned below to generate the Fivetran API key and API secret:
- Click your user name in your Fivetran dashboard.
- Click API Key.
- Click Generate API key. (If you already have an API key, then the button text is Generate new API key.)
- Make a note of the key and secret as they won't be displayed once you close the page or navigate away.
For more detailed documentation visit [here](https://fivetran.com/docs/rest-api/getting-started).
- **apiSecret**: Fivetran API Secret. From the above step where the API key is generated copy the API secret
- **hostPort**: HostPort of the Fivetran instance. By default, OpenMetadata will use `https://api.fivetran.com` to connect to the Fivetran APIs.
- **limit**: Fivetran API Limit For Pagination. This refers to the maximum number of records that can be returned in a single page of results when using Fivetran's API for pagination.
