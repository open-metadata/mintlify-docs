In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Wherescape connector.
Configure and schedule Wherescape metadata workflow from the OpenMetadata UI:
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
    - [Connection Details](#connection-details)
- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/pipeline/wherescape/troubleshooting)
## Requirements
To extract Wherescape metadata, we need the batabase connection details where the metadata is stored.
- `API` Permission ( While Creating the User, from Admin -> User )
- To retrieve lineage data, the user must be granted [Component-level permissions](https://docs.matillion.com/metl/docs/2932106/#component).

# Connection Details

<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
</Tip>
- **Connection**: Wherescape metadata database connection.
In terms of `connection` we support the following selections:
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: To connect to the Wherescape metadata database:
  - Provide the SQL Server connection credentials including username and password
  - Specify the database name where Wherescape metadata is stored
  - Enter the host and port for the SQL Server instance
  - The connector will establish a connection to this database to extract Wherescape pipeline metadata
