In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Matillion connector.
Configure and schedule Matillion metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:
- [Requirements](#requirements)
    - [Matillion Versions](#matillion-versions)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
    - [Connection Details](#connection-details)
- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/pipeline/matillion/troubleshooting)
    - [Workflow Deployment Error](#workflow-deployment-error)
## Requirements
To extract metadata from Matillion, you need to create a user with the following permissions:
- `API` Permission ( While Creating the User, from Admin -> User )
- To retrieve lineage data, the user must be granted [Component-level permissions](https://docs.matillion.com/metl/docs/2932106/#component).
- To enable lineage tracking in Matillion, **Matillion Enterprise Mode** is required. For detailed setup instructions and further information, refer to the official documentation: [Matillion Lineage Documentation](https://docs.matillion.com/metl/docs/2881895/).
### Matillion Versions
OpenMetadata is integrated with matillion up to version [1.75.0](https://docs.matillion.io/getting-started).

# Connection Details
<Steps>
<Step title="Connection Details">
<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
</Tip>
- **hostPort**: The hostname or IP address with the REST API enabled eg.`https://<your-matillion-host-name-here>`
- **username**: The username to authenticate with the Matillion instance.
- **password**: The password to authenticate with the Matillion instance.
- **caCertificate** : CA Certificate to authenticate with the Matillion instance.
