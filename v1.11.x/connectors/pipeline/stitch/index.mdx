In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Stitch connector.
Configure and schedule Stitch metadata and profiler workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/pipeline/stitch/troubleshooting)
## Requirements
To extract metadata from Stitch, User first need to crate API crednetials:
- `Token`: Token to access Stitch metadata.
## Metadata Ingestion
<MetadataIngestionUi connector={"Stitch"} selectServicePath={"/public/images/connectors/stitch/select-service.png"} addNewServicePath={"/public/images/connectors/stitch/add-new-service.png"} serviceConnectionPath={"/public/images/connectors/stitch/service-connection.png"} />
# Connection Details
<Steps>
<Step title="Connection Details">
<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
</Tip>
- **hostPort**: This parameter specifies the network location where your Stitch instance is accessible, combining both the hostname. It is based on the account and region where user has hosted his/her data pipelines. More about this you can check [here](https://www.stitchdata.com/docs/developers/import-api/api#base-urls)
- **token**: Token to get access to Stitch metadata. This token is created by user after logging into stitch console. More about this, please check [here](https://www.stitchdata.com/docs/developers/import-api/guides/quick-start#obtain-api-credentials)
