# Metadata Ingestion

The goal of OpenMetadata is to serve as a centralised platform where users can gather and collaborate
around data. This is possible thanks for different workflows that users can deploy and schedule, which will
connect to the data sources to extract metadata.

Different metadata being ingested to OpenMetadata can be:

- Entities metadata, such as Tables, Dashboards, Topics...
- Query usage to rank the most used tables,
- Lineage between Entities,
- Data Profiles and Quality Tests.

In this section we will explore the different workflows, how they work and how to use them.
