Configure and schedule S3 metadata workflows from the CLI:

## Requirements
<Card title="OpenMetadata 1.0 or later" href="/deployment" >
    To deploy OpenMetadata, check the Deployment guides.
  </Card>
To run the metadata ingestion, we need the following permissions in AWS:
### S3 Permissions
For all the buckets that we want to ingest, we need to provide the following:
- `s3:ListBucket`
- `s3:GetObject`
- `s3:GetBucketLocation`
- `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`
Note that the `Resources` should be all the buckets that you'd like to scan. A possible policy could be:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
### CloudWatch Permissions
Which is used to fetch the total size in bytes for a bucket and the total number of files. It requires:
- `cloudwatch:GetMetricData`
- `cloudwatch:ListMetrics`
The policy would look like:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudwatch:GetMetricData",
                "cloudwatch:ListMetrics"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```
### Python Requirements
<PythonRequirements />
To run the Athena ingestion, you will need to install:
```bash
pip3 install "openmetadata-ingestion[athena]"
```
### OpenMetadata Manifest
In any other connector, extracting metadata happens automatically. In this case, we will be able to extract high-level
metadata from buckets, but in order to understand their internal structure we need users to provide an `openmetadata.json`
file at the bucket root.
`Supported File Formats: [ "csv",  "tsv", "avro", "parquet", "json", "json.gz", "json.zip" ]`
You can learn more about this [here](/connectors/storage). Keep reading for an example on the shape of the manifest file.
<Manifest />
## Metadata Ingestion
All connectors are defined as JSON Schemas.
[Here](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/entity/services/connections/storage/s3Connection.json)
you can find the structure to create a connection to Athena.
In order to create and run a Metadata Ingestion workflow, we will follow
the steps to create a YAML configuration able to connect to the source,
process the Entities if needed, and reach the OpenMetadata server.
The workflow is modeled around the following
[JSON Schema](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/blob/main/openmetadata-spec/src/main/resources/json/schema/metadataIngestion/workflow.json)
