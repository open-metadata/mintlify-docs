This page contains the setup guide and reference information for the GCS connector.
Configure and schedule GCS metadata workflows from the OpenMetadata UI:
- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Metadata Ingestion](#metadata-ingestion)
- [Troubleshooting](/connectors/storage/gcs/troubleshooting)
## Requirements
We need the following permissions in GCP:
### GCS Permissions
For all the buckets that we want to ingest, we need to provide the following:
- `storage.buckets.get`
- `storage.buckets.list`
- `storage.objects.get`
- `storage.objects.list`
### OpenMetadata Manifest
In any other connector, extracting metadata happens automatically. In this case, we will be able to extract high-level
metadata from buckets, but in order to understand their internal structure we need users to provide an `openmetadata.json`
file at the bucket root.
`Supported File Formats: [ "csv",  "tsv", "avro", "parquet", "json", "json.gz", "json.zip" ]`
You can learn more about this [here](/connectors/storage). Keep reading for an example on the shape of the manifest file.

## Metadata Ingestion
<Steps>
<Step title="Visit the Services Page">
  The first step is ingesting the metadata from your sources. Under
Settings, you will find a Services link an external source system to
OpenMetadata. Once a service is created, it can be used to configure
metadata, usage, and profiler workflows.
To visit the Services page, select Services from the Settings menu.

</Step>
<Step title="Create a New Service">
  Click on the 'Add New Service' button to start the Service creation.

</Step>
<Step title="Select the Service Type">
  Select GCS as the service type and click Next.

</Step>
<Step title="Name and Describe your Service">
  Provide a name and description for your service.
#### Service Name
OpenMetadata uniquely identifies services by their Service Name. Provide
a name that distinguishes your deployment from other services, including
the other Storage services that you might be ingesting metadata
from.

</Step>
<Step title="Configure the Service Connection">
  In this step, we will configure the connection settings required for
this connector. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that
you've configured the connector to read from your GCS service as
desired.

<Tip>
When using a **Hybrid Ingestion Runner**, any sensitive credential fields—such as passwords, API keys, or private keys—must reference secrets using the following format:
```
password: secret:/my/database/password
```
This applies **only to fields marked as secrets** in the connection form (these typically mask input and show a visibility toggle icon).
For a complete guide on managing secrets in hybrid setups, see the [Hybrid Ingestion Runner Secret Management Guide](https://docs.getcollate.io/getting-started/day-1/hybrid-saas/hybrid-ingestion-runner#3.-manage-secrets-securely).
