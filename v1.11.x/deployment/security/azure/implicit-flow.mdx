- Click on Register.

### Step 2: Where to Find the Credentials

- The `Client ID` and the `Tenant ID` are displayed in the Overview section of the registered application.

- When passing the details for `authority`, the `Tenant ID` is added to the URL as shown in the example
  below. `https://login.microsoftonline.com/TenantID`

```commandline
"authority": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/c11234b7c-b1b2-9854-0mn1-56abh3dea295"
