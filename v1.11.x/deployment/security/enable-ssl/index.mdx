# Enable SSL

In this section we will guide you through adding SSL to your OpenMetadata deployment with two different approaches:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Use Nginx" href="/deployment/security/enable-ssl/nginx" >
    Use Nginx to enable SSL. This is the simplest solution.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use the OpenMetadata Server" href="/deployment/security/enable-ssl/openmetadata-server" >
    Set SSL directly at the OpenMetadata server.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
