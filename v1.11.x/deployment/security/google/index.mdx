# Google SSO

Follow the sections in this guide to set up Google SSO.

<Tip>

Security requirements for your **production** environment:
- **DELETE** the admin default account shipped by OM in case you had [Basic Authentication](/deployment/security/basic-auth)
  enabled before configuring the authentication with Google SSO.
- **UPDATE** the Private / Public keys used for the [JWT Tokens](/deployment/security/enable-jwt-tokens). The keys we provide
  by default are aimed only for quickstart and testing purposes. They should NEVER be used in a production installation.

</Tip>

## Create Server Credentials

### Step 1: Create the Account
- Go to [Create Google Cloud Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
