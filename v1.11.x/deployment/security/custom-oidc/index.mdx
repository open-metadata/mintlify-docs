# Custom OIDC SSO

Follow the sections in this guide to set up Custom OIDC SSO.

<Tip>

Security requirements for your **production** environment:
- **DELETE** the admin default account shipped by OM in case you had [Basic Authentication](/deployment/security/basic-auth)
  enabled before configuring the authentication with Custom OIDC SSO.
- **UPDATE** the Private / Public keys used for the [JWT Tokens](/deployment/security/enable-jwt-tokens). The keys we provide
  by default are aimed only for quickstart and testing purposes. They should NEVER be used in a production installation.

</Tip>

## Create Server Credentials

- Go to the console of your preferred custom OIDC SSO provider
- Create an OIDC client application with implicit flow enabled to get a client ID.

### Create Client ID and Secret Key

- Navigate to your preferred OIDC provider console and create an OIDC client application.
- Generate client ID and secret key in JSON format.

After the applying these steps, you can update the configuration of your deployment:

  Configure Custom OIDC SSO for Docker deployment.
</Card>
<Card title="Kubernetes" href="/deployment/security/custom-oidc/kubernetes" >
  Configure Custom OIDC SSO for Kubernetes deployment.
</Card>
<Card title="Bare Metal" href="/deployment/security/custom-oidc/bare-metal" >
  Configure Custom OIDC SSO for Bare Metal deployment.
</Card>
</CardGroup>
