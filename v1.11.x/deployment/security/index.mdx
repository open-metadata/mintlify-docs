# Enable Security

This section provides detailed instructions to secure the REST endpoints of the OpenMetadata Server.

OpenMetadata has support for Google SSO, Okta SSO, custom OIDC, Auth0, Azure SSO, Amazon Cognito, and OneLogin as identity providers. Please see the next sections about how to configure them.

Enabling Security is only required for your **Production** installation. If you are testing OpenMetadata, it will be easier
and faster to set up without security. To get up and running quickly with OpenMetadata (without security),
please follow the [Quickstart](/quick-start) guide.

<Tip>

OpenMetadata currently does not support the simultaneous use of multiple authentication mechanisms, such as combining SSO and Basic Authentication.
