# Amazon Cognito SSO

Follow the sections in this guide to set up Amazon Cognito SSO.

<Tip>

Security requirements for your **production** environment:
- **DELETE** the admin default account shipped by OM in case you had [Basic Authentication](/deployment/security/basic-auth)
  enabled before configuring the authentication with Amazon Cognito SSO.
- **UPDATE** the Private / Public keys used for the [JWT Tokens](/deployment/security/enable-jwt-tokens) in case it is
  enabled.

</Tip>

## Create Server Credentials

### Step 1: Login to AWS Portal

- Login to [Amazon AWS Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/).
- Search for `Cognito` in the search box and select Cognito Service from the dropdown menu.

- Select the type of ID providers you want to configure for your users and click "Next"

- In the same step, select "Public client" for the Initial App client type and configure the Allowed callback URLs
  with `http://localhost:8585/callback` as shown in the screenshot below. Note: For production deployments, the Allowed
  callback URLs should be updated with the appropriate domain name.
