# OneLogin SSO

Follow the sections in this guide to set up OneLogin SSO.

<Tip>
Security requirements for your **production** environment:
- **DELETE** the admin default account shipped by OM in case you had [Basic Authentication](/deployment/security/basic-auth)
  enabled before configuring the authentication with OneLogin SSO.
- **UPDATE** the Private / Public keys used for the [JWT Tokens](/deployment/security/enable-jwt-tokens). The keys we provide
  by default are aimed only for quickstart and testing purposes. They should NEVER be used in a production installation.

## Create Server Credentials

### Step 1: Configure a new Application

- Login to [OneLogin](https://www.onelogin.com/) as an administrator and click on Applications
