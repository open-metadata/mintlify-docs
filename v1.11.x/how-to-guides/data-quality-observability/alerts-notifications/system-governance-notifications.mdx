# System & Governance Notifications

Stay informed about metadata changes, governance events, and collaboration activities across your data catalog.

## Open the Notifications Page

## Create a new Alert

Provide a unique, descriptive **Name** for your alert. You can also add an optional **Description** to provide further context and clarity regarding the alert's intent.

## Select the Metadata Entity to Monitor

Choose the specific entity type whose changes you want to track. These sources include data assets (like **Table** or **Pipeline**) as well as governance and platform entities (like **Glossary**, **Tag**, **User**, or **Announcement**).
Any relevant change to the selected entity will generate an event for this notification.

## Configure Filters (Optional)

<Note>
If you do not set any filter, the alert will apply to **all** events over the selected source entity type.
</Note>

Filters allow refining the scope of the alert to focus only on relevant changes. The available filter criteria depend on the source entity selected. Events can be narrowed down basing on a variety of criteria, including:

* **Owner:** Filter events based on the designated owner of the asset.
* **Entity FQN:** Filter by the Fully Qualified Name of the entity.
* **Event Type:** Filter by the specific action that occurred (e.g., Created, Updated, Deleted).
* **Updater Name:** Filter based on the user or service that executed the change.
* **Domain:** Filter events based on the Data Domain the entity belongs to.
* **Filter By Updater Is Bot:** Filter to include or exclude changes made by automated ingestion or system processes.

Use the **Include** toggle to define the logic for the filter condition:
* **Include (Toggle ON):** If the event meets the filter condition, the alert is **sent**.
* **Exclude (Toggle OFF):** If the event meets the filter condition, the alert is **silenced** (not sent).

You can add multiple filters to a single alert subscription.
