# Data Observability Alerts

Monitor the health of your data systems by setting up alerts for pipeline failures, data quality issues, and schema changes.

## Open the Alerts Page

Navigate to the lateral menu **Observability > Alerts**.

Click the **Add Alert** button.

## Name the Alert and Add Context

Provide a unique, descriptive **Name** for your alert. You can also add an optional **Description** to provide further context and clarity regarding the alert's intent.

## Select a Source

Choose the operational entity you want to monitor:

* **Container** - Monitors schema changes for the container asset
* **Ingestion Pipeline** - Monitors status changes to your Collate ingestion pipelines
* **Pipeline** - Monitors updates to pipeline assets that you have ingested
* **Table** - Monitors schema changes and table metrics changes
* **Test Case** - Triggers an alert for the specific test case selected
* **Test Suite** - Triggers an alert for any test case event linked to the test suite. This is a great way to group alerts and reduce notification fatigue
* **Topic** - Monitors schema changes for the topic asset

## Configure Filters (Optional)

Filters allow you to refine the scope of the alert to focus only on relevant changes, significantly improving the signal-to-noise ratio. You can narrow down events based on a variety of criteria, including:

* **Entity Specific Name:** Filter by the defined specific name of the entity.
* **Owner Name:** Filter events based on the designated owner of the asset.
* **Domain:** Filter events based on the Data Domain the entity belongs to.
* **Filter By Updater Is Bot:** Filter to include or exclude changes made by automated ingestion or system processes.

Use the **Include** toggle to define the logic for the filter condition:
* **Include (Toggle ON):** If the event meets the filter condition, the alert is **sent**.
* **Exclude (Toggle OFF):** If the event meets the filter condition, the alert is **silenced** (not sent).

<Note>
If you do not set any filter, the alert will apply to **all** relevant events over the selected source entity type, which may lead to excessive notifications.

## Select Trigger Conditions (Optional)

Define the specific conditions that will trigger the alert:

* **Schema Changes** - Alert on added, deleted, or updated columns
* **Test Case Status** - Trigger when tests are `Failed`, `Aborted`, or `Queued`
* **Pipeline Status** - Alert when pipeline execution is `Failed` or `Pending`
* **Metric Updates** - Notify when table metrics are updated

<Tip>
You can select multiple trigger conditions to create comprehensive monitoring coverage.
