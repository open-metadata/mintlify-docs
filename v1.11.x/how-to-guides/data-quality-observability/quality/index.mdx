# Overview of Data Quality

With Collate, you can build trust in your data by creating tests to monitor that the data is complete, fresh, and accurate. Collate supports data quality tests for all of the supported database connectors. Users can run tests at the table and column levels to verify their data for business as well as technical use cases.

Collate provides Data Quality workflows, which helps with:
- **Native tests** for all database connectors to run assertions.
- **Alerting system** to send notifications on test failure.
- **Health dashboard** to track realtime test failure and to prioritize efforts.
- **Resolution workflow** to inform the data consumer on test resolutions.

The data quality in Collate is also **extensible** to adapt to your needs.
