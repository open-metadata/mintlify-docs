# Getting Started with Goose Desktop

Configure Collate's MCP Server to interact with block's AI agent [Goose](https://github.com/block/goose).

## Prerequisites
For this guide, you will need:
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and npx/node version 22
- Collate v1.8.0 or later- You can upgrade your version of Collate with [this guide](https://docs.open-metadata.org/latest/deployment/upgrade)
- [Goose Desktop](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/quickstart/)
- Collate [MCP Application and Personal Access Token](https://docs.open-metadata.org/v1.9.x/how-to-guides/mcp#installing-mcp-server)

## Adding your Collate MCP Server to Goose Desktop
This how-to guide uses Goose Desktop for macOS. Make sure that you already have an [LLM Provider configured](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/quickstart/#configure-provider) before prompting.

- Navigate to Goose Desktop's Settings, then under *Extensions*, select *+Add custom extension*.

- The custom extension should have the following information:
  - *Extension Name* `Collate`
  - *Command* paste the following command:
    ```
    npx -y mcp-remote <YOUR_Collate_SERVER>/mcp --auth-server-url=<YOUR_Collate_SERVER>/mcp --client-id=Collate --verbose --clean --header Authorization:${AUTH_HEADER}
    ```
    - If you are running [it locally](https://docs.open-metadata.org/latest/quick-start/local-docker-deployment), your command will look like this:
      ```
      npx -y mcp-remote http://localhost:8585/mcp --auth-server-url=http://localhost:8585/mcp --client-id=Collate --verbose --clean --header Authorization:${AUTH_HEADER}
      ```
  - Add 1 *Environment Variable*
    - *Variable name* is `AUTH_HEADER`
    - *Value* is `Bearer &lt;YOUR_Collate_PAT&gt;`

## Prompt to read from Collate
This part of the guide assumes that you have assets in Collate. You can add data assets into Collate [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/latest/connectors).

Select a model from Goose and paste the following prompt to have it read from Collate:
```
What tables do you have access to in Collate?
```

### Reach out on Slack!
With MCP, we are finding new ways to use Collate all the time! Now that you have Claude and Collate configured to work together, think you've got a great new use case? Show us what you've got in [Slack](https://slack.open-metadata.org/)!
