# Getting Started with Claude Desktop

Configure Collate's MCP Server to interact with Anthropic's AI assistant platform.

## Prerequisites
For this guide, you will need:

- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and npx/node version 22
- Collate v1.8.0 or later - You can upgrade your version of Collate with [this guide](https://docs.open-metadata.org/latest/deployment/upgrade)
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
- Collate [MCP Application and Personal Access Token](https://docs.open-metadata.org/v1.9.x/how-to-guides/mcp#installing-mcp-server)

## Adding your Collate MCP Server to Claude Desktop
This how-to guide uses the free version of Claude Desktop for macOS with Sonnet 4.

- Navigate to Claude Desktop's Settings, then select *Developer* and *Edit Config*. Paste the following into `claude_desktop_config.json`

```
{"mcpServers": {
    "Collate": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "<YOUR-Collate-SERVER>/mcp",
        "--auth-server-url=<YOUR-Collate-SERVER>/mcp",
        "--client-id=Collate",
        "--verbose",
        "--clean",
        "--header",
        "Authorization:${AUTH_HEADER}"
      ],
      "env": {
        "AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer <YOUR-Collate-PAT>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Restart Claude Desktop. You should see your `Collate` service running

## Prompt to read from Collate
This part of the guide assumes that you have assets in Collate that Claude can read, and that some of your data assets have references to customers. You can change the prompt accordingly and/or add data sources into Collate [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/latest/connectors).

Paste the following prompt into Claude to have it read from Collate:
```
Imagine you're a data analyst tasked with building a customer retention dashboard. Can you help me identify which tables or datasets in the Collate database might contain relevant information?
```

Claude will ask if it can use the external integration `Collate`, select *Allow always*. You may have to do this multiple times, once for each tool. Claude is now reading from Collate via its MCP Server!

### Reach out on Slack!
With MCP, we are finding new ways to use Collate all the time! Now that you have Claude and Collate configured to work together, think you've got a great new use case? Show us what you've got in [Slack](https://slack.open-metadata.org/)!
