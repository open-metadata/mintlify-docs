# Conversation Threads

As part of Data Collaboration feature of Collate, Conversation Threads were one of the earliest features introduced to enable users to easily ask any questions that they might have around a data asset. In the 0.9.0 release of Collate, we introduced the ability to reply and create entire conversation
threads around all the various activities across any data asset. In release 0.11.0, we took it to the next level by extending conversation threads to Tasks and adding support for reactions with emojis.

Across Collate, users can start conversations around description, column description, tags, announcements, glossary terms of a data asset by clicking the chat icon as shown in the screen-shot below.

Users can also reply or react with emojis for any Conversation by hovering over the conversation.
