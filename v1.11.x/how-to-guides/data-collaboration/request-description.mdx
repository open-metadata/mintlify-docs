# How to Request for Description

Apart from adding the a description to the data assets directly, users can also request to update description. This is typically done when the user wants another opinion on the description being added, or if the user does not have access to edit the description. Requesting for a description will create a Task in Collate.

- Click on the **?** icon next to Description

Once a task has been created, it is displayed in the **Activity Feeds & Tasks** tab for that Data Asset. The assignees, can either `Accept the Suggestion` or `Edit and Accept the Suggestion`. Assignees can also add a **Comment**. They can also add other users as **Assignees**.
