# How to Ingest Metadata

*This section deals with integrating third-party sources with Collate and running the workflows from the UI.*

Collate gives you the flexibility to bring in your data from third-party sources using CLI, or the UI. Let’s start with ingesting your metadata from various sources through the UI. Follow the easy steps to add a connector to fetch metadata on a regular basis at your desired frequency.

<Tip>

**Note:** Ensure that you have **Admin access** in the source tools to be able to add a connector and ingest metadata.

</Tip>

Admin users can connect to multiple data sources like Databases, Dashboards, Pipelines, ML Models, Messaging, Storage, as well as Metadata services.

Let’s start with an example of fetching metadata from a database service, i.e., Snowflake.

- Start by creating a service connection by clicking on **Settings** from the left nav bar. Navigate to the **Services** section, and click on **Databases**. Click on **Add New Service**.

- Select the Database service of your choice. For example, Snowflake. Click **Next**.

- To configure Snowflake, enter a unique service name. Click **Next**.
  - **Name:** No spaces allowed. Apart from letters and numbers, you can use _ - . & ( )
  - **Description:** It is optional, but best to add documentation to improve data culture.

- Enter the **Connection Details**. The Connector documentation is available right within Collate in the right side panel. The connector details will differ based on the service selected. Users can add their credentials to create a service and further set up the workflows.

- Users can **Test the Connection** before creating the service. Test Connection checks for access, and also about what details can be ingested using the connection.

- The **Connection Status** will verify access to the service as well as to the data assets. Once the connection has been tested, you can save the details.
<img src="/public/images/how-to-guides/admin-guide/testconnection1.png" alt="Connection Successful" />

- Add the default schema, database, and table patterns, then click Save to create and configure the database service. Administrators can subsequently set up pipelines to ingest source data into Collate.
  - Clicking on **Save** will navigate to the Database service page, where you can view the Insights, Databases, Agents, and Connection Details Tabs. You can also **Add the Metadata Agent** from the Agents tab.

  - Or, you can directly start with **Adding Agent**.

<Tip>
**Tip:** In the Service page, the **Connection Tab** provides information on the connection details as well as details on what data can be ingested from the source using this connection.
</Tip>

- Click on **Add Agent** and enter the details to ingest metadata:
  - **Name:** The name is randomly generated, and includes the Service Name, and a randomly generated text to create a unique name.
  - **Database Filter Pattern:** to include or exclude certain databases. A database service has multiple databases, of which you can selectively ingest the required databases.
  - **Schema Filter Pattern:** to include or exclude certain schemas. A database can have multiple schemas, of which you can selectively ingest the required schemas.
  - **Table Filter Pattern:** Use the toggle options to:
    - Use FQN for Filtering
    - Include Views - to generate lineage
    - Include Tags
    - Enable Debug Log: We recommend enabling the debug log.
    - Mark Deleted Tables
  - **View Definition Parsing Timeout Limit:** The default is set to 300.

- **Schedule Metadata Agent** - Define when the metadata Agent pipeline must run on a regular basis. Users can also use a **Custom Cron** expression.
<img src="/public/images/how-to-guides/admin-guide/schedule.png" alt="Schedule and Deploy Metadata Agent" />

After the pipeline has been created and deployed successfully, click on **View Service**. The **Agents Tab** will provide all the details for the recent runs, like if the pipeline is queued, running, failed, or successful. On hovering over the Agent details, admin users can view the scheduling frequency, as well as the start and end times for the recent runs. Users can perform certain actions, like:
- **Run** the pipeline now.
- **Kill** to end all the currently running pipelines.
- **Redeploy:** When a  service connection is setup, it fetches the data as per the access provided. If the connection credentials are changed at a later point in time, redeploying will fetch additional data with updated access, if any.

By connecting to a database service, you can ingest the databases, schemas, tables, and columns. In the Service page, the **Databases Tab** will display all the ingested databases. Users can further drilldown to view the **Schemas**, and **Tables**.

<Tip>
**Note:** Once you’ve run a metadata Agent pipeline, you can create separate pipelines to bring in [**Usage**](/connectors/ingestion/workflows/usage), [**Lineage**](/connectors/ingestion/workflows/lineage), [**dbt**](/connectors/ingestion/workflows/dbt), or to run [**Profiler**](/how-to-guides/data-quality-observability/profiler/profiler-workflow). To add pipelines, select the required type of Agent and enter the required details.
</Tip>

Admin users can create, edit, or delete services. They can also view the connection details for the existing services.

<Tip>
**Pro Tip:** Refer to the [Best Practices for Metadata Agent](/connectors/ingestion/best-practices).
