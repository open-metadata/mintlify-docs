# How to Add a Team

Creating a Team in Collate is easy. Decide on the `teamType` that you would like to add. Refer to the [**Team Structure in Collate**](/how-to-guides/admin-guide/teams-and-users) to get a clear understanding of the various **Team Types**.

**1.** Click on **Settings >> Team & User Management >> Teams**. Further, navigate to the relevant `BusinessUnit`, `Division`, or `Department` where you would like to create a new team. Click on **Add Team**.

**2.** Enter the details like `Name`, `Display Name`, `Email`, `Team Type`, and `Description` and click on **OK**. The choice of the `teamType` is restricted by the type of the parent team selected. More information can be found in the [**Team Structure**](/how-to-guides/admin-guide/teams-and-users) document. Enable the **Public Team** option to allow open access, permitting anyone to join the team, view data, and collaborate.

<Warning>
- Once created, the teamType for `Group` **cannot be changed later**.
- Only the Teams of the type `Group` can **own data assets**.
</Warning>
