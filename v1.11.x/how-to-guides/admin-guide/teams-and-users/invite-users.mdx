# How to Invite Users to Collate

Data is a team game and Collate is a platform to discover, collaborate and get your data right. Collaboration works best when all the team members have access to a standard tool. Admins can send invitations and invite users to onboard to Collate.

- Navigate to **Settings >> Team & User Management >> Users** and click on **Add Users**.
