# How to Add Users to Teams

If the user does not already exist in Collate, then [invite the user](/how-to-guides/admin-guide/teams-and-users/invite-users) to Collate. While creating the **new user**, you can add them to the relevant **Team** as well as assign them the relevant **Roles**.

<Tip>
**Note:** You can add a User to multiple Teams when creating a New User.
