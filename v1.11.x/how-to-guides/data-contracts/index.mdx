# Overview of Data Contracts

Collate is a centralized, active metadata repository where all your data resides. In any organization, it is important to get the consumers utilizing data assets aligned with asset producers. As data platform adoption increases in an organization, a data mesh architecture with Collate Data Contracts can produce automated schema, semantic, and data quality validations that enforce data quality and SLAs across departments and domains.

Contracts in Collate are now available for tables. With Collate Data Contracts, you can set the expected schema structure of an asset, define its semantics (like ensuring that a table has a description field or an [owner assigned](https://docs.open-metadata.org/latest/how-to-guides/guide-for-data-users/data-ownership)), assign data quality tests, and track a data contract's execution history over time.
