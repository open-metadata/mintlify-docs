# Create Data Contract

Data contracts are currently available for tables ingested into Collate. The following guide shows how a data contract was created for a snowflake.DEMO_STAGE.JAFFLE_SHOP.CUSTOMERS table.

To create a Data Contract for a Table in Collate:
- Go to the Table's page, select **Contract**, then **+ Add Contract**

- In *Contract Details*, be sure to give your new data contract a name. Optionally, you can assign Owners and provide a description of your data contract. Then select **Schema**.

- Select the columns of your table that you would like to add to your new data contract, or select all columns by checking the box at the top right. Then select **Semantics**

- Add the business rules you would like to enforce in *Semantics*. For Collate Tables, rules can be created for:
  - Service
  - Owners
  - Display Name
  - Name
  - Description
  - Tags
  - Domain
  - Data Product
  - Tier
