# How to Bulk Import a Glossary

Collate supports **Glossary Bulk Upload** to save time and effort by uploading a CSV with thousands of terms in one go. You can create or update multiple glossary terms simultaneously. When bulk uploading, Owners and Reviewers can be defined, who will be further propagated to every glossary term.

- Once you have the template, you can fill in the following details:
  - **parent** - The parent column helps to define the hierarchy of the glossary terms. If you leave this field blank, the Term will be created at the root level. If you want to create a hierarchy of Glossary Terms, the parent details must be entered as per the hierarchy. For example, from the Glossary level, `Banking.Account.Savings Account`

  <img src="/public/images/how-to-guides/governance/glossary9.png" alt="Hierarchy can be defined in the Parent Column" />
  - **name*** - This contains the name of the glossary term, and is a required field.

  - **displayName** - This contains the Display name of the glossary term.

  - **description*** - This contains the description or details of the glossary term and is a required field.

  - **synonyms** - Include words that have the same meaning as the glossary term. For e.g., for a term ‘Customer’, the synonyms can be ‘Client’, ‘Shopper’, ‘Purchaser’. In the CSV file, the synonyms must be separated by a semicolon (;) as in `Client;Shopper;Purchaser`

  - **relatedTerms** - A term which has a related concept as the glossary term. This term must be available in Collate. For e.g., for a term ‘Customer’, the related terms can be ‘Customer LTV (LifeTime Value)’, ‘Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)’. In the CSV file, the relatedTerms must contain the hierarchy, which is separated by a full stop (.). Multiple terms must be separated by a semicolon (;) as in `Banking.Account.Savings account;Banking.Debit card`
  - **references** - Add links from the internet from where you inherited the term. In the CSV file, the references must be in the format (name;url;name;url) `IBM;https://www.ibm.com/;World Bank;https://www.worldbank.org/`
  - **tags** - Add the tags which are already existing in Collate. In the CSV file, the tags must be in the format `PII.Sensitive;PersonalData.Personal`

## Mutually Exclusive

You can also mark the Glossary as Mutually Exclusive if you want only one of the terms from the glossary to be applicable to the data assets. There are cases where only one glossary term from a Glossary is relevant for a data asset. For example, an asset can either be PII Sensitive or PII Non-Sensitive. It cannot be both. For such cases, a Glossary can be created where the terms can be mutually exclusive. If this configuration is enabled, you won’t be able to assign multiple tags from the same Glossary to the same data asset.

## Add Owners and Reviewers to a Glossary

If the Owner details are added while creating the glossary, the same will be inherited for the glossary terms. Either a Team or a User can be the **Owner** of a Glossary. Multiple users can be **Reviewers**. These can be changed later. The glossary **Owner and Reviewers** are inherited for all the glossary terms.

- Once the CSV file is ready, click on the ⋮ icon and select the **Import** button.

- Drag and drop the CSV file, or upload it by clicking on the Browse button.
