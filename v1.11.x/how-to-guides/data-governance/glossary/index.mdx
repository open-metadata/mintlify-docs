# Glossary

A Glossary is a Controlled Vocabulary to describe important concepts and terminologies within your organization to foster a common and consistent understanding of data. A controlled vocabulary is an organized arrangement of words and phrases to define terminology to organize and retrieve information.

Glossary adds semantics or meaning to data by defining the business terminologies. It defines concepts related to a specific domain. For example, Business Glossary or Bank Glossary. A well-defined business glossary helps foster team collaboration with the use of standard terms. The terms from the glossary can be used for labeling or tagging as additional metadata of data assets for describing and categorizing things. Glossaries are important for data discovery, retrieval, and exploration through conceptual terms, and facilitates **Data Governance**.

## Glossary in Collate

Collate models a Glossary as a Thesauri that organizes terms with **hierarchical**, equivalent, and associative relationships within a domain. The Glossary in Collate can be accessed from **Govern >>  Glossary**. All the Glossaries are displayed in the left nav bar. Clicking on a specific glossary will display the expanded view to show the entire hierarchy of the glossary terms (parent-child terms).

<Tip>
**Tip:** A well-defined and centralized glossary makes it easy to **onboard new team members** and help them get familiar with the **organizational terminology**.

## Glossary APIs

Collate has extensive Glossary APIs. The main entities are **Glossary** and **Glossary Term**. These entities are identified by a Unique ID. Glossary terms have a fully qualified name in the form of `glossary.parentTerm.childTerm`

You can create, delete, modify, and update using APIs. Refer to the **[Glossary API documentation](https://sandbox.open-metadata.org/docs#tag/Glossaries)**.
