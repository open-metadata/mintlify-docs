# OpenMetadata Standards

OpenMetadata Standards is the community-driven home for the schemas and ontologies behind Collate. It provides the canonical JSON Schemas, RDF/OWL models, and API specifications that power data cataloging, governance, lineage, quality, and observability.

Key highlights:

- **Comprehensive coverage**: 700+ JSON Schemas spanning entities, relationships, events, and configuration.
- **API-first**: REST and event schemas for search, feeds, webhooks, and bulk operations.
- **Semantic web ready**: RDF/OWL ontologies and SHACL shapes for knowledge graph and linked data use cases.
- **Standards compliant**: JSON Schema (Draft 07/2020-12), RDF/OWL, SHACL, JSON-LD, PROV-O.
- **Community driven**: Built and maintained by the OpenMetadata community with open governance.
