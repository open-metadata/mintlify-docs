# Thread

*This schema defines the Thread entity. A Thread is a collection of posts made by the users. The first post that starts a thread is **about** a data asset **from** a user. Other users can respond to this post by creating new posts in the thread. Note that bot users can also interact with a thread. A post can contains links that mention Users or other Data Assets.*
