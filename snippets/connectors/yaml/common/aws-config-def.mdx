AWS Access Key Credentials

**awsAccessKeyId** and **awsSecretAccessKey** are used to authenticate and authorize programmatic requests to AWS services.

An access key consists of:
- **Access Key ID** (for example, `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`)
- **Secret Access Key** (for example, `wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`)

Both values must be provided together when using static credentials.

For more information, see
[Managing access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html).

AWS Session Token

**awsSessionToken** is required when using **temporary security credentials**, such as those obtained via AWS STS.

The session token must be provided along with the access key ID and secret access key for the duration of the session.

AWS Region

**awsRegion** specifies the AWS Region where the target service is deployed (for example, `us-east-1`).

This is the **only required parameter** when configuring an AWS connection. Other credentials can be resolved automatically using environment variables, AWS profiles, or IAM roles.

Learn more in the
[AWS Regions and Availability Zones documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html).

Custom Endpoint URL

**endPointURL** is an optional custom endpoint used to connect to an AWS service.

You may want to specify this when:
- Using VPC endpoints
- Connecting to local or AWS-compatible services
- Overriding the default regional endpoint

See
[AWS service endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) for details.

AWS Profile Name

**profileName** specifies the AWS CLI profile to use for authentication.

Profiles store credentials and configuration in AWS config files.
If not specified, the `default` profile is used.

Learn more about
[Named profiles for the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html).

Assume Role ARN

**assumeRoleArn** is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to assume.

This is commonly used for:
- Cross-account access
- Delegated permissions
- Enhanced security setups

This field is **required** when using Assume Role authentication.

See the
[AssumeRole API reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html).

Assume Role Session Name

**assumeRoleSessionName** identifies the assumed role session.

This value helps uniquely identify a session when the same role is assumed multiple times or by different principals.

If not provided, the default value `OpenMetadataSession` is used.

Assume Role Source Identity

**assumeRoleSourceIdentity** is an optional source identity passed when assuming a role.

This value is recorded in AWS CloudTrail logs and can be used to trace actions performed using the assumed role.

See
[Source Identity in AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html).
